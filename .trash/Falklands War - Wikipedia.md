# [Falklands War - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War)

The **Falklands War** (Spanish: *Guerra de las Malvinas*) was a ten-week [undeclared war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undeclared_war "Undeclared war") between [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina "Argentina") and the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") in 1982 over two [British dependent territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories "British Overseas Territories") in the South Atlantic: the [Falkland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands "Falkland Islands") and [its territorial dependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_Dependencies "Falkland Islands Dependencies"), [South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands "South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands").

The conflict began on 2 April, when [Argentina invaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_invasion_of_the_Falkland_Islands "1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands") and [occupied the Falkland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Falkland_Islands "Occupation of the Falkland Islands"), followed by the [invasion of South Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_South_Georgia "Invasion of South Georgia") the next day. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a [naval task force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_naval_forces_in_the_Falklands_War "British naval forces in the Falklands War") to engage the [Argentine Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Navy "Argentine Navy") and [Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Air_Force "Argentine Air Force") before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three [Falkland Islanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islanders "Falkland Islanders") died during the hostilities.

The conflict was a major episode in the [protracted dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Falkland_Islands "History of the Falkland Islands") over the territories' [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty "Sovereignty"). Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory,[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-4) and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a [Crown colony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_colony "Crown colony") since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly [favour British sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_Falkland_Islands_status_referendum "1986 Falkland Islands status referendum"). Neither state officially [declared war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war"), although both governments declared the Islands a war zone.

The conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various [books, articles, films, and songs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_the_Falklands_War "Cultural impact of the Falklands War"). Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the unfavourable outcome prompted large protests against the [ruling military government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Reorganization_Process "National Reorganization Process"), hastening its downfall and the [democratisation of the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Argentine_general_election "1983 Argentine general election"). In the United Kingdom, the [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)") government, bolstered by the successful outcome, [was re-elected with an increased majority the following year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_United_Kingdom_general_election "1983 United Kingdom general election"). The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it has remained a common topic for discussion.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-5)

Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in [Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid "Madrid"), at which the two governments issued a joint statement.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-6) No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina adopted a new [Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Argentina "Constitution of Argentina"),[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-7) which declared the Falkland Islands as part of one of its provinces by law.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-8) However, the islands continue to operate as a [self-governing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governing_colony "Self-governing colony") [British Overseas Territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories "British Overseas Territories").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOOTNOTECahill2010%22Falkland_Islands%22-9)

## Prelude\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Prelude")\]

### Failed diplomacy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Failed diplomacy")\]

In 1965, the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations") called upon Argentina and the United Kingdom to reach a settlement of the sovereignty dispute. The UK [Foreign and Commonwealth Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office") (FCO) regarded the islands as a nuisance and barrier to UK trade in South America. Therefore, while confident of British sovereignty, the FCO was prepared to cede the islands to Argentina. When news of a proposed transfer broke in 1968, elements sympathetic with the plight of the islanders were able to organise an effective [Parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom "Parliament of the United Kingdom") lobby to frustrate the FCO plans. Negotiations continued but in general, failed to make meaningful progress; the islanders steadfastly refused to consider Argentine sovereignty on one side, whilst Argentina would not compromise over sovereignty on the other.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Welch-10) The FCO then sought to make the islands dependent on Argentina, hoping this would make the islanders more amenable to Argentine sovereignty. A Communications Agreement signed in 1971 created an airlink and later YPF, the Argentine oil company, was given a monopoly in the islands.

In 1980, a new [Minister of State for Foreign Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_State_for_Foreign_Affairs_(United_Kingdom) "Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (United Kingdom)"), [Nicholas Ridley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Ridley,_Baron_Ridley_of_Liddesdale "Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale"), went to the Falklands trying to sell the islanders the benefits of a [leaseback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaseback "Leaseback") scheme, which met with strong opposition from the islanders. On returning to [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") in December 1980 he reported to parliament but was viciously attacked at what was seen as a sellout. (It was unlikely that leaseback could have succeeded since the British had sought a long-term lease of 99 years, whereas Argentina was pressing for a much shorter period of only ten years.) At a private committee meeting that evening, it was reported that Ridley cried out: "If we don't do something, they will invade. And there is nothing we could do."[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Eddy,_et_al-11)

### The Argentine junta\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The Argentine junta")\]

[![](inbox/assets/150px-Jorge_Anaya.JPG.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jorge_Anaya.JPG)

[Jorge Anaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Anaya "Jorge Anaya") was the driving force in the Junta's decision to invade[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-12)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-14)

[![](inbox/assets/151px-Retrato_Oficial_Galtieri.jpg.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Retrato_Oficial_Galtieri.jpg)

In the period leading up to the war—and, in particular, following the transfer of power between the military dictators General [Jorge Rafael Videla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Rafael_Videla "Jorge Rafael Videla") and General [Roberto Eduardo Viola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Eduardo_Viola "Roberto Eduardo Viola") late in March 1981—Argentina had been in the midst of devastating economic stagnation and large-scale civil unrest against the [military *junta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship "Military dictatorship") that had been governing the country since 1976.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-15)[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-16)

In December 1981 there was a further change in the Argentine military regime, bringing to office a new *junta* headed by General [Leopoldo Galtieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopoldo_Galtieri "Leopoldo Galtieri") (acting president), Air Brigadier [Basilio Lami Dozo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilio_Lami_Dozo "Basilio Lami Dozo") and Admiral [Jorge Anaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Anaya "Jorge Anaya"). Anaya was the main architect and supporter of a military solution for the long-standing claim over the islands,[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-17) calculating that the United Kingdom would never respond militarily.[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-18)

By opting for military action, the Galtieri government hoped to mobilise the long-standing patriotic feelings of Argentines towards the islands, [diverting public attention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversionary_foreign_policy "Diversionary foreign policy") from the chronic economic problems and the ongoing human rights violations of its [Dirty War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War "Dirty War"),[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-19) bolstering the junta's dwindling legitimacy. The newspaper *[La Prensa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Prensa_(Buenos_Aires) "La Prensa (Buenos Aires)")* speculated on a step-by-step plan beginning with cutting off supplies to the islands, ending in direct actions late in 1982, if the UN talks were fruitless.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Jimmy_Burns,1987-20)

The ongoing tension between the two countries over the islands increased on 19 March, when a group of Argentine scrap metal merchants (which had been infiltrated by [Argentine Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Marines "Argentine Marines"))[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-21) raised the [Argentine flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_flag "Argentine flag") at [South Georgia Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Georgia_Island "South Georgia Island"), an act that would later be seen as the first offensive action in the war. The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel [HMS *Endurance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endurance_(1967) "HMS Endurance (1967)") was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response. The Argentine military junta, suspecting that the UK would reinforce its South Atlantic Forces, ordered the [invasion of the Falkland Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_invasion_of_the_Falkland_Islands "1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands") to be brought forward to 2 April.

The UK was initially taken by surprise by the Argentine attack on the South Atlantic islands, despite repeated warnings by Royal Navy captain [Nicholas Barker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Barker_(Royal_Navy_officer) "Nicholas Barker (Royal Navy officer)") (Commanding Officer of the *Endurance*) and others. Barker believed that Defence Secretary [John Nott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nott "John Nott")'s [1981 Defence White Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Defence_White_Paper "1981 Defence White Paper") (in which Nott described plans to withdraw the *Endurance*, the UK's only naval presence in the South Atlantic) had sent a signal to the Argentines that the UK was unwilling, and would soon be unable, to defend its territories and subjects in the Falklands.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-22)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-23)

## Argentine invasion\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Argentine invasion")\]

Argentinian soldiers and Falklanders in 1982

On 2 April 1982 Argentine forces mounted amphibious landings, known as Operation Rosario,[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-24) on the Falkland Islands.[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-25) The invasion was met with a fierce but brief defence organised by the [Falkland Islands' Governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_the_Falkland_Islands "Governor of the Falkland Islands") [Sir Rex Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Hunt_(governor) "Rex Hunt (governor)"), giving command to Major Mike Norman of the [Royal Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines "Royal Marines"). The garrison consisted of 68 marines and eleven naval [hydrographers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrography "Hydrography"),[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-26) They were assisted by 23 volunteers of the [Falkland Islands Defence Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_Defence_Force "Falkland Islands Defence Force") (FIDF), who had few weapons and were used as lookouts.[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-27) The invasion started with the landing of [Lieutenant Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Commander "Lieutenant Commander") Guillermo Sanchez-Sabarots' [Amphibious Commandos Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_Commandos_Group "Amphibious Commandos Group"), who attacked the empty Moody Brook barracks and then moved on [Government House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House,_Falkland_Islands "Government House, Falkland Islands") in [Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley,_Falkland_Islands "Stanley, Falkland Islands"). When the 2nd [Marine Infantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_Marines "Argentina Marines") Battalion with [Assault Amphibious Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_Amphibious_Vehicle "Assault Amphibious Vehicle") arrived, the governor ordered a cease fire and surrendered.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-28) The governor, his family and the British military personnel were flown to Argentina that afternoon and later repatriated to the United Kingdom.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-29)

### Initial British response\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Initial British response")\]

The British had already taken action prior to the 2 April invasion. In response to events on South Georgia, on 29 March, Ministers decided to send the [Royal Fleet Auxiliary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Fleet_Auxiliary "Royal Fleet Auxiliary") (RFA) *[Fort Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Fort_Austin_(A386) "RFA Fort Austin (A386)")* south from the Mediterranean to support HMS *Endurance*, and the submarine [HMS *Spartan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Spartan_(S105) "HMS Spartan (S105)") from [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar "Gibraltar"), with [HMS *Splendid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Splendid_(S106) "HMS Splendid (S106)") ordered south from [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMNB_Clyde "HMNB Clyde") the following day.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman,_Gamba-Stonehouse_1991-30): 75 [\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman2007-31) [Lord Carrington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Carington,_6th_Baron_Carrington "Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington") had wished to send a third submarine, but the decision was deferred due to concerns about the impact on operational commitments.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman2007-31) Coincidentally, on 26 March, the submarine [HMS *Superb*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Superb_(S109) "HMS Superb (S109)") left Gibraltar and it was assumed in the press she was heading south. There has since been speculation that the effect of those reports was to panic the Argentine junta into invading the Falklands before nuclear-powered submarines could be deployed;[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman2007-31) however, post-war research has established that the final decision to proceed was made at a junta meeting in Buenos Aires on 23 March.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-32)

The following day, during a crisis meeting headed by the Prime Minister, [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher "Margaret Thatcher"), the Chief of the Naval Staff, [Admiral Sir Henry Leach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Leach "Henry Leach"), advised them that "Britain could and should send a task force if the islands are invaded". On 1 April, Leach sent orders to a [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") force carrying out [exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise "Military exercise") in the Mediterranean to prepare to sail south. Following the invasion on 2 April, after an emergency meeting of the cabinet, approval was given to form a task force to retake the islands. This was backed in an emergency session of the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom "House of Commons of the United Kingdom") the next day.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-falkislands-33)

Word of the invasion first reached the UK from Argentine sources.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Margolis-34) A [Ministry of Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom) "Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)") operative in London had a short [telex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex "Telex") conversation with Governor Hunt's telex operator, who confirmed that Argentines were on the island and in control.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Margolis-34)[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Duncan-35) Later that day, [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") journalist [Laurie Margolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Margolis "Laurie Margolis") spoke with an islander at [Goose Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_Green "Goose Green") via [amateur radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio "Amateur radio"), who confirmed the presence of a large Argentine fleet and that Argentine forces had taken control of the island.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Margolis-34) British military operations in the Falklands War were given the codename *Operation Corporate*, and the commander of the task force was Admiral Sir [John Fieldhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fieldhouse,_Baron_Fieldhouse "John Fieldhouse, Baron Fieldhouse"). Operations lasted from 1 April 1982 to 20 June 1982.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-LG_13_December_1982-36)

[![](inbox/assets/200px-The_empire_strikes_back_newsweek.jpg.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_empire_strikes_back_newsweek.jpg)

On 6 April, the British Government set up a [War Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Cabinet#Falklands_War,_1982 "War Cabinet") to provide day-to-day political oversight of the campaign.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman2005-37) This was the critical instrument of crisis management for the British with its remit being to "keep under review political and military developments relating to the South Atlantic, and to report as necessary to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee". The War Cabinet met at least daily until it was dissolved on 12 August. Although [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher "Margaret Thatcher") is described as dominating the War Cabinet, [Lawrence Freedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Freedman "Lawrence Freedman") notes in the *Official History of the Falklands Campaign* that she did not ignore opposition or fail to consult others. However, once a decision was reached she "did not look back".[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman2005-37)

### United Nations Security Council Resolution 502\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: United Nations Security Council Resolution 502")\]

On 31 March 1982, the Argentine ambassador to the UN, [Eduardo Roca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_A._Roca "Eduardo A. Roca"), began attempting to garner support against a British military build-up designed to thwart earlier UN resolutions calling for both countries to resolve the Falklands dispute through discussion.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman,_Gamba-Stonehouse_1991-30): 134  On 2 April, the night of the invasion, a banquet was held at Roca's official residence for the US ambassador to the UN, [Jeane Kirkpatrick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeane_Kirkpatrick "Jeane Kirkpatrick"), and several high-ranking officials of the [United States Department of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State "United States Department of State") and the [United States Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense"). This led British diplomats to view Kirkpatrick, who had earlier called for closer relationships with South American dictatorships, with considerable suspicion.[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-38)

On 1 April, London told the UK ambassador to the UN, Sir [Anthony Parsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Parsons "Anthony Parsons"), that an invasion was imminent and he should call an urgent meeting of the [Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council "United Nations Security Council") to get a favourable [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_resolution "United Nations resolution") against Argentina.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-39) Parsons had to get nine affirmative votes from the 15 Council members (not a simple majority) and to avoid a blocking vote from any of the other four permanent members. The meeting took place at 11:00 am on 3 April, New York time (4:00 pm in London). [United Nations Security Council Resolution 502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_502 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 502") was adopted by 10 to 1 (with Panama voting against) and 4 abstentions. Significantly, the Soviet Union and China both abstained.[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-40)[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-42) The resolution stated that the UN Security Council was:

Deeply disturbed at reports of an invasion on 2 April 1982 by armed forces of Argentina;

Determining that there exists a breach of the peace in the region of the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas),

Demands an immediate cessation of hostilities;

Demands an immediate withdrawal of all Argentine forces from the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas)

Calls on the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom to seek a diplomatic solution to their differences and to respect fully the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.

This was a significant win for the UK, giving it the upper hand diplomatically. The draft resolution Parsons submitted had avoided any reference to the sovereignty dispute (which might have worked against the UK): instead it focused on Argentina's breach of Chapter VII of the UN Charter which forbids the threat or use of force to settle disputes.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-43) The resolution called for the removal only of Argentine forces: this freed Britain to retake the islands militarily, if Argentina did not leave, by exercising its right to self-defence, that was allowed under the UN Charter.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman,_Gamba-Stonehouse_1991-30): 141 

### Argentinian occupation\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Argentinian occupation")\]

The Argentinian Army unit earmarked for the occupation was the [25th Infantry Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25th_Infantry_Regiment_(Argentina) "25th Infantry Regiment (Argentina)"), a unit of 1,000 conscripts specially selected to represent all the [regions of Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Argentina "Regions of Argentina"); it was flown into Stanley Airport as soon as the runway had been cleared.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-44) Once it became clear that the British were sending an amphibious task force, there was a general recall of reservists and two [brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade "Brigade") of eight infantry regiments and their supporting units were dispatched to the islands. The total Argentinian garrison numbered some 13,000 troops by the beginning of May. The conscripts born in 1963 had only recently been called-up, so they were supplemented by the recall of the previous year's intake. Brigadier General [Mario Benjamín Menéndez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Benjam%C3%ADn_Men%C3%A9ndez "Mario Benjamín Menéndez") was appointed Military Governor of the Malvinas.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-45)

During the conflict there was no widespread abuse of the civilian population.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-harvnb|Freedman|2005b|p=87-46) Argentine military police arrived with detailed files on many islanders[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Bound-47) allowing intelligence officer Major Patricio Dowling to arrest and interrogate islanders who he suspected might lead opposition to the occupying .[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Bound-47) Initially, Islanders suspected of holding anti-Argentine views were expelled,[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Bound-47) including the Luxton family[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Bound-47) (who had lived in the islands since the 1840s) and David Colville,[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-48) editor of the Falkland's Times. This proved to be counter-productive, as those expelled gave interviews to the press; subsequently, fourteen other community leaders, including the senior medical officer, were interned at [Fox Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Bay "Fox Bay") on West Falkland.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-49) Concerned by Dowling's actions, senior Argentine officers had him removed from the islands.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Bound-47) For almost a month, the civilian population of [Goose Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_Green "Goose Green") was detained in the [village hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_hall "Village hall") in squalid conditions.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-harvnb|Freedman|2005b|p=87-46) Less well known is that similar detentions took place in other outlying settlements and in one case led to the death of an islander denied access to his medication. In the closing moments of the war, some troops began to place booby traps in civilian homes,[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-50) defiled homes with excrement,[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-51) destroyed civilian property and committed arson against civilian properties.[\[52\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-52)

The British government had no contingency plan for an invasion of the islands, and the task force was rapidly put together from whatever vessels were available.[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-GS-53) The nuclear-powered submarine [*Conqueror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Conqueror_(S48) "HMS Conqueror (S48)") set sail from Faslane on 4 April. The two aircraft carriers [*Invincible*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Invincible_(R05) "HMS Invincible (R05)") and [*Hermes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hermes_(R12) "HMS Hermes (R12)") and their escort vessels left [Portsmouth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth "Portsmouth") only a day later.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-falkislands-33) On its return to Southampton from a world cruise on 7 April, the ocean liner [SS *Canberra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Canberra "SS Canberra") was requisitioned and set sail two days later with [3 Commando Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Commando_Brigade "3 Commando Brigade") aboard.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-falkislands-33) The ocean liner *[Queen Elizabeth 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_2 "Queen Elizabeth 2")* was also requisitioned and left [Southampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton "Southampton") on 12 May with [5th Infantry Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5th_Infantry_Brigade_(United_Kingdom) "5th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)") on board.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-falkislands-33) The whole task force eventually comprised 127 ships: 43 [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") vessels, 22 [Royal Fleet Auxiliary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Fleet_Auxiliary "Royal Fleet Auxiliary") ships, and 62 [merchant ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_Navy_(United_Kingdom) "Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)").[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-GS-53)

The retaking of the Falkland Islands was considered extremely difficult. The chances of a British counter-invasion succeeding were assessed by the [US Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy"), according to historian [Arthur L. Herman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_L._Herman "Arthur L. Herman"), as "a military impossibility".[\[54\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-54) Firstly, the British were significantly constrained by the disparity in deployable air cover.[\[55\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman2005_air_threat-55) The British had 42 aircraft (28 [Sea Harriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Harriers "Sea Harriers") and 14 [Harrier GR.3s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Siddeley_Harrier "Hawker Siddeley Harrier")) available for air combat operations,[\[56\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-56) against approximately 122 serviceable jet fighters, of which about 50 were used as [air superiority fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_superiority_fighter "Air superiority fighter") and the remainder as [strike aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_aircraft "Strike aircraft"), in [Argentina's air forces during the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_air_forces_in_the_Falklands_War "Argentine air forces in the Falklands War").[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:1-57) Crucially, the British lacked [airborne early warning and control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_early_warning_and_control "Airborne early warning and control") (AEW) aircraft. Planning also considered the Argentine surface fleet and the threat posed by [Exocet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocet "Exocet")\-equipped vessels or the two [Type 209 submarines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_209_submarine "Type 209 submarine").[\[58\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Hastings_and_Jenkins-58)

By mid-April, the [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force "Royal Air Force") had set up the airbase of [RAF Ascension Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Ascension_Island "RAF Ascension Island"), co-located with Wideawake Airfield on the mid-[Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean "Atlantic Ocean") British overseas territory of [Ascension Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_Island "Ascension Island"), including a sizeable force of [Avro Vulcan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Vulcan "Avro Vulcan") B Mk 2 bombers, [Handley Page Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Victor "Handley Page Victor") K Mk 2 [refuelling aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refuelling "Aerial refuelling"), and [McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR Mk 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-4_Phantom_II "F-4 Phantom II") [fighters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft "Fighter aircraft") to protect them. Meanwhile, the main British naval task force arrived at Ascension to prepare for active service. A small force had already been sent south to recapture South Georgia.

Encounters began in April; the British Task Force was shadowed by [Boeing 707](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707") aircraft of the [Argentine Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Air_Force "Argentine Air Force") during their travel to the south.[\[59\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-59) Several of these flights were intercepted by Sea Harriers outside the British-imposed [Total Exclusion Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Exclusion_Zone "Total Exclusion Zone"); the unarmed 707s were not attacked because diplomatic moves were still in progress and the UK had not yet decided to commit itself to armed force. On 23 April, a Brazilian commercial [Douglas DC-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10 "McDonnell Douglas DC-10") from [VARIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VARIG "VARIG") Airlines en route to South Africa was intercepted by British Harriers who visually identified the civilian plane.[\[60\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-60)

### Recapture of South Georgia and the attack on *Santa Fe*\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Recapture of South Georgia and the attack on Santa Fe")\]

The South Georgia force, [Operation Paraquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paraquet "Operation Paraquet"), under the command of Major Guy Sheridan RM, consisted of Marines from [42 Commando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_Commando "42 Commando"), a troop of the [Special Air Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service "Special Air Service") (SAS) and [Special Boat Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Boat_Service "Special Boat Service") (SBS) troops who were intended to land as [reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance "Reconnaissance") forces for an invasion by the Royal Marines, a total of 240 men. All were embarked on [RFA *Tidespring*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Tidespring_(A75) "RFA Tidespring (A75)"). First to arrive was the [*Churchill*\-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill-class_submarine "Churchill-class submarine") [submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine "Submarine") HMS *Conqueror* on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a radar-mapping [Handley Page Victor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handley_Page_Victor "Handley Page Victor") on 20 April, to establish that no Argentinian ships were in the vicinity.[\[61\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-61)

[![](inbox/assets/220px-USS_Catfish%3B0833910.jpg.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USS_Catfish;0833910.jpg)

The first landings of SAS and SBS troops took place on 21 April, but a mission to establish an observation post on the [Fortuna Glacier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortuna_Glacier "Fortuna Glacier") had to be withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in fog and high winds. On 23 April, a submarine alert was sounded and operations were halted, with *Tidespring* being withdrawn to deeper water to avoid interception. On 24 April, the British forces regrouped and headed in to attack.[\[62\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-62)

On 25 April, after resupplying the Argentine garrison in South Georgia, the submarine [ARA *Santa Fe*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Santa_Fe_(S-21) "ARA Santa Fe (S-21)") was spotted on the surface[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-handle.dtic.mil-63) by a [Westland Wessex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Wessex "Westland Wessex") HAS Mk 3 helicopter from [HMS *Antrim*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Antrim_(D18) "HMS Antrim (D18)"), which attacked the Argentine submarine with [depth charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_charges "Depth charges"). [HMS *Plymouth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Plymouth_(F126) "HMS Plymouth (F126)") launched a [Westland Wasp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Wasp "Westland Wasp") HAS.Mk.1 helicopter, and [HMS *Brilliant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Brilliant_(F90) "HMS Brilliant (F90)") launched a [Westland Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Lynx "Westland Lynx") HAS Mk 2. The Lynx launched a [torpedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpedo "Torpedo"), and [strafed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafed "Strafed") the submarine with its [pintle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pintle "Pintle")\-mounted [general purpose machine gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L7_(machine_gun) "L7 (machine gun)"); the Wessex also fired on *Santa Fe* with its [GPMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_machine_gun "General-purpose machine gun"). The Wasp from [HMS *Plymouth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Plymouth_(F126) "HMS Plymouth (F126)") as well as two other Wasps launched from [HMS *Endurance*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endurance_(1967) "HMS Endurance (1967)") fired [AS-12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospatiale_SS.12/AS.12 "Aerospatiale SS.12/AS.12") [ASM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-to-surface_missile "Air-to-surface missile") [antiship missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_missile "Anti-ship missile") at the submarine, scoring hits. *Santa Fe* was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at [King Edward Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Edward_Point "King Edward Point") on South Georgia.[\[64\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-64)

With *Tidespring* now far out to sea, and the Argentine forces augmented by the submarine's crew, Major Sheridan decided to gather the 76 men he had and make a direct assault that day. After a short forced march by the British troops and a naval bombardment demonstration by two Royal Navy vessels (*Antrim* and *Plymouth*), the Argentine forces, a total of 190 men, surrendered without resistance.[\[65\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-65) The message sent from the naval force at South Georgia to London was, "Be pleased to inform Her Majesty that the [White Ensign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ensign "White Ensign") flies alongside the [Union Jack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Jack "Union Jack") in South Georgia. God Save the Queen." The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, broke the news to the media, telling them to ["Just rejoice at that news, and congratulate our forces and the Marines!"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejoice_(Margaret_Thatcher) "Rejoice (Margaret Thatcher)")[\[66\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-fn_1-66)

### Black Buck raids\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Black Buck raids")\]

[![](inbox/assets/220px-Avro_Vulcan_Bomber_RAF.JPEG.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Avro_Vulcan_Bomber_RAF.JPEG)

On 1 May British operations on the Falklands opened with the "Black Buck 1" attack (of a series of five) on the airfield at Stanley. A [Vulcan bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Vulcan "Avro Vulcan") from [Ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_Island "Ascension Island") flew an 8,000-nautical-mile (15,000 km; 9,200 mi) round trip, dropping conventional bombs across the runway at Stanley. The mission required repeated [refuelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_refuelling "Aerial refuelling") using several Victor K2 tanker aircraft operating in concert, including tanker-to-tanker refuelling.[\[67\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-67) The overall effect of the raids on the war is difficult to determine. The runway was cratered by only one of the twenty one bombs, but as a result, the Argentines realised that their mainland was vulnerable and fighter aircraft were redeployed from the theatre to bases further north.[\[68\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-68)

Historian [Lawrence Freedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Freedman "Lawrence Freedman"), who was given access to official sources, comments that the significance of the Vulcan raids remains a subject of controversy.[\[69\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-69) Although they took pressure off the small Sea Harrier force, the raids were costly and used a great deal of resources. The single hit in the centre of the runway was probably the best that could have been expected, but it did reduce the capability of the runway to operate fast jets and caused the Argentine air force to deploy Mirage IIIs to defend the capital.[\[70\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-70) Argentine sources confirm that the Vulcan raids influenced Argentina to shift some of its Mirage IIIs from southern Argentina to the Buenos Aires Defence Zone.[\[71\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-71)[\[72\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-72)[\[73\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-73) This dissuasive effect was watered down when British officials made clear that there would not be strikes on air bases in Argentina.[\[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-74) The raids were later dismissed as propaganda by Falklands veteran Commander Nigel Ward.[\[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-75)

Of the five Black Buck raids, three were against Stanley Airfield, with the other two being anti-radar missions using [Shrike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM-45_Shrike "AGM-45 Shrike") [anti-radiation missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-radiation_missile "Anti-radiation missile").[\[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-burdp36357-76)

### Escalation of the air war\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Escalation of the air war")\]

[![](inbox/assets/220px-Super_Etendard_ARA_204.jpg.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Super_Etendard_ARA_204.jpg)

The Falklands had only three airfields. The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, [Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley,_Falkland_Islands "Stanley, Falkland Islands"), and even that was too short to support fast jets. Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, [combat air patrols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_air_patrol "Combat air patrol"), and [close air support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support "Close air support") over the islands. The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, limiting the ability of fighters to protect attack aircraft, which were often compelled to attack the first target of opportunity, rather than selecting the most lucrative target.[\[77\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-77)

The first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ([A-4 Skyhawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk "Douglas A-4 Skyhawk"), [IAI Daggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Nesher "IAI Nesher"), [English Electric Canberras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Electric_Canberra "English Electric Canberra"), and [Mirage III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Mirage_III "Dassault Mirage III") escorts), and was sent on 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft) found ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted the morale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the islands and by using a late [pop up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toss_bombing "Toss bombing") profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by [BAE Sea Harriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Sea_Harrier "BAE Sea Harrier") operating from [HMS *Invincible*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Invincible_(R05) "HMS Invincible (R05)"). A Dagger[\[78\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-78) and a Canberra were shot down.[\[79\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-79)

Combat broke out between Sea Harrier FRS Mk 1 fighters of No. 801 Naval Air Squadron and [Mirage III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Mirage_III "Dassault Mirage III") fighters of Grupo 8. Both sides refused to fight at the other's best altitude, until two Mirages finally descended to engage. One was shot down by an [AIM-9L Sidewinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-9_Sidewinder "AIM-9 Sidewinder") [air-to-air missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-to-air_missile "Air-to-air missile") (AAM), while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland airbase. The plane made for Stanley, where it fell victim to friendly fire from the Argentine defenders.[\[80\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-80)

As a result of this experience, Argentine Air Force staff decided to employ A-4 Skyhawks and Daggers only as strike units, the Canberras only during the night, and Mirage IIIs (without air refuelling capability or any capable AAM) as decoys to lure away the British Sea Harriers. The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the [Escuadrón Fénix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escuadr%C3%B3n_F%C3%A9nix "Escuadrón Fénix"), a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours a day, simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet. On one of these flights on 7 June, an Air Force [Learjet 35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learjet_35 "Learjet 35")A was shot down, killing the squadron commander, Vice Commodore Rodolfo De La Colina, the highest-ranking Argentine officer to die in the war.[\[81\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-81)[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-82)

Stanley was used as an Argentine strongpoint throughout the conflict. Despite the Black Buck and Harrier raids on Stanley airfield (no fast jets were stationed there for air defence) and overnight shelling by detached ships, it was never out of action entirely. Stanley was defended by a mixture of [surface-to-air missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile "Surface-to-air missile") (SAM) systems (Franco-German [Roland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_(missile) "Roland (missile)") and British [Tigercat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Cat "Sea Cat")) and light anti-aircraft guns, including Swiss-built [Oerlikon 35 mm twin anti-aircraft cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oerlikon_35_mm_twin_cannon "Oerlikon 35 mm twin cannon") and 30 mm Hispano-Suiza cannon and German [Rheinmetall 20 mm twin anti-aircraft cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinmetall_Mk_20_Rh-202#20_mm_twin_anti-aircraft_mount_variant "Rheinmetall Mk 20 Rh-202"). More of the anti-aircraft guns were deployed to the airstrip at Goose Green.[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-burdp17-8-83)[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-84) [Lockheed Hercules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-130_Hercules "Lockheed C-130 Hercules") transport night flights brought supplies, weapons, vehicles, and fuel, and airlifted out the wounded up until the end of the conflict.[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-burdp792-85)

The only Argentine Hercules shot down by the British was lost on 1 June when TC-63 was intercepted by a Sea Harrier in daylight[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-86)[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-87) when it was searching for the British fleet north-east of the islands after the Argentine Navy retired its last [SP-2H Neptune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_P-2_Neptune "Lockheed P-2 Neptune") due to unreliability.[\[88\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-burdp48,801-88)

Various options to attack the home base of the five Argentine [Étendards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault-Breguet_Super_%C3%89tendard "Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard") at [Río Grande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Grande,_Tierra_del_Fuego "Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego") were examined and discounted ([Operation Mikado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mikado "Operation Mikado")); subsequently five Royal Navy submarines lined up, submerged, on the edge of Argentina's 12-nautical-mile (22 km; 14 mi) territorial limit to provide early warning of bombing raids on the British task force.[\[89\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-89)

### Sinking of ARA *General Belgrano*\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Sinking of ARA General Belgrano")\]

ARA *General Belgrano* sinking

On 30 April, the British government had brought into force a 200 nautical mile (370 km; 230 mi) Total Exclusion Zone (TEZ) to replace the previous Maritime Exclusion Zone; aircraft as well as ships of any nation were liable to attack inside it, if they were aiding the Argentinian occupation. Admiral Woodward's carrier battle group of twelve warships and three supply ships entered the TEZ on 1 May, shortly before the first Black Buck raid, intending to degrade Argentinian air and sea forces before the arrival of the amphibious group two weeks later.[\[90\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-90) In anticipation, Admiral Anaya had deployed all his available warships into three task groups. The first was centred around the aircraft carrier [ARA *Veinticinco de Mayo*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Veinticinco_de_Mayo_(V-2) "ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)") with two old but missile-armed destroyers and a second comprised three modern frigates; both these groups were intended to approach the TEZ from the north. A third group approaching from the south was led by the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War")\-vintage Argentine [light cruiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cruiser "Light cruiser") [ARA *General Belgrano*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_General_Belgrano "ARA General Belgrano");[\[91\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-91) although old, her large guns and heavy armour made her a serious threat, and she was escorted by two modern [Type 42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_42_destroyer "Type 42 destroyer") [guided-missile destroyers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided-missile_destroyer "Guided-missile destroyer"), armed with Exocet missiles.[\[92\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-92)

On 1 May, the *Belgrano* group was located by the British nuclear-powered submarine [HMS *Conqueror*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Conqueror_(S48) "HMS Conqueror (S48)") (one of three patrolling the TEZ), and followed it until the following day, when it was about 12 hours away from the Task Force and just outside the Total Exclusion Zone. Admiral Woodward was aware of the Argentinian carrier group approaching from the other direction, and ordered the cruiser to be attacked to avoid being caught in a [pincer movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pincer_movement "Pincer movement"); he was unaware that the *Veinticinco de Mayo* had failed to gain enough headwind to launch her aircraft. The order to sink the cruiser was confirmed by the [War Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_cabinet#Falklands_War "War cabinet") in London and the *General Belgrano* was hit by two torpedoes at 4 pm local time on 2 May, sinking an hour later.[\[93\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-93) 368 members of *General Belgrano*'s crew died in the incident. More than 700 men were eventually rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather, enduring up to 30 hours in overcrowded life rafts.[\[94\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-94) The loss of *General Belgrano* drew heavy criticism from Latin American countries and from opponents of the war in Britain; support for the British cause wavered amongst some European allies, but critically, the United States remained supportive.[\[95\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-95)

Regardless of [controversies over the sinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_General_Belgrano#Controversy_over_the_sinking "ARA General Belgrano") — including disagreement about the exact nature of the exclusion zone and whether *General Belgrano* had been returning to port at the time of the sinking — it had a crucial strategic effect: the elimination of the Argentine naval threat. After her loss, the entire Argentine fleet, with the exception of the diesel-powered submarine [ARA *San Luis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_San_Luis_(S-32) "ARA San Luis (S-32)"),[\[63\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-handle.dtic.mil-63) returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting. This had the secondary effect of allowing the British to redeploy their nuclear submarines to the coast of Argentina, where they were able to provide early warning of outgoing air attacks leaving mainland bases.[\[96\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-96) However, settling the controversy in 2003, the ship's captain Hector Bonzo confirmed that *General Belgrano* had actually been manoeuvering, not sailing away from the exclusion zone, and that the captain had orders to sink any British ship he could find.[\[97\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-97)

In a separate incident later that night, British forces engaged an Argentine patrol gunboat, the [ARA *Alferez Sobral*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Alferez_Sobral_(A-9) "ARA Alferez Sobral (A-9)"), that was searching for the crew of an Argentine Air Force [Canberra light bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Electric_Canberra "English Electric Canberra") shot down on 1 May. Two Royal Navy [Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Lynx "Westland Lynx") helicopters, from [HMS *Coventry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Coventry_(D118) "HMS Coventry (D118)") and [HMS *Glasgow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Glasgow_(D88) "HMS Glasgow (D88)"), fired four [Sea Skua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Skua "Sea Skua") missiles at her. Badly damaged and with eight crew dead, *Alferez Sobral* managed to return to [Puerto Deseado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Deseado "Puerto Deseado") two days later.[\[98\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-burdp179-98) The Canberra's crew were never found.[\[99\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-burdp912-99)

On 4 May, two days after the sinking of *General Belgrano*, the British lost the [Type 42 destroyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_42_destroyer "Type 42 destroyer") [HMS *Sheffield*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Sheffield_(D80) "HMS Sheffield (D80)") to fire following an [Exocet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocet "Exocet") missile strike from the Argentine [2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2da_Escuadrilla_Aeronaval_de_Caza_y_Ataque "2da Escuadrilla Aeronaval de Caza y Ataque").[\[100\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-100)

*Sheffield* had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long-range radar and medium-high altitude missile [picket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_picket "Radar picket") far from the British carriers. She was struck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by fires. For four days she was kept afloat for inspections and the hope that she might attract Argentinian submarines which could be hunted by helicopter. The decision was then taken to tow her to Ascension, but while under tow by [HMS *Yarmouth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Yarmouth_(F101) "HMS Yarmouth (F101)"), she finally sank east of the Falklands on 10 May.[\[101\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-101)

The incident is described in detail by Admiral [Sandy Woodward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Woodward "Sandy Woodward") in his book *One Hundred Days*, in Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of *Sheffield*.[\[102\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-102) The destruction of *Sheffield*, the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War, had a profound impact on the War Cabinet and the British public as a whole, bringing home the fact that the conflict was now an actual shooting war.[\[103\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-103)

### Diplomatic activity\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Diplomatic activity")\]

The tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentines. The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary General [Pérez de Cuéllar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9rez_de_Cu%C3%A9llar "Pérez de Cuéllar") on 18 May 1982. In it, the British abandoned their previous "red-line" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentine forces, as supported by [United Nations Security Council Resolution 502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_502 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 502").\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]

Instead, it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentine and British forces, then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands, including Argentines, although no Argentines lived there. Reference to "[self-determination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination "Self-determination")" of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN.[\[104\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-104)

### Special forces operations\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Special forces operations")\]

Given the threat to the British fleet posed by the Étendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in some [SAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service "Special Air Service") troops to attack the home base of the five Étendards at [Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_Grande,_Tierra_del_Fuego "Río Grande, Tierra del Fuego"). The operation was codenamed "[Mikado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mikado "Operation Mikado")". The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine [HMS *Onyx*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Onyx_(S21) "HMS Onyx (S21)") to drop SAS operatives several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile.[\[105\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-105)

An SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration. A [Westland Sea King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Sea_King "Westland Sea King") helicopter carrying the assigned team took off from HMS *Invincible* on the night of 17 May, but bad weather forced it to land 50 miles (80 km) from its target and the mission was aborted.[\[106\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-106) The pilot flew to [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile"), landed south of [Punta Arenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punta_Arenas "Punta Arenas"), and dropped off the SAS team. The helicopter's crew of three then destroyed the aircraft, surrendered to Chilean police on 25 May, and were repatriated to the UK after interrogation. The discovery of the burnt-out helicopter attracted considerable international attention. Meanwhile, the SAS team crossed the border and penetrated into Argentina, but cancelled their mission after the Argentines suspected an SAS operation and deployed some 2,000 troops to search for them. The SAS men were able to return to Chile, and took a civilian flight back to the UK.[\[107\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-107)

On 14 May the SAS carried out a [raid on Pebble Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_on_Pebble_Island "Raid on Pebble Island") on the Falklands, where the Argentine Navy had taken over a grass airstrip [map](https://maps.google.com/maps?t=h&q=-51.308889,-59.610278&ll=-51.308887,-59.610271&spn=0.022964,0.055189&z=14) for [FMA IA 58 Pucará](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_IA_58_Pucar%C3%A1 "FMA IA 58 Pucará") light ground-attack aircraft and [Beechcraft T-34 Mentors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beechcraft_T-34_Mentor "Beechcraft T-34 Mentor"), which resulted in the destruction of several aircraft.[\[nb 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-108)[\[108\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-mid12p1901-109)

On 15 May, SBS teams were inserted by HMS *Brilliant* at [Grantham Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grantham_Sound "Grantham Sound") to reconnoitre and observe the landing beaches at San Carlos Bay.[\[109\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-110) On the evening of 20 May, the day before the main landings, an SBS troop and artillery observers were landed by Wessex helicopters for an assault on an Argentinian observation post at Fanning Head which overlooked the entrance the bay; meanwhile, the SAS conducted a diversionary raid at [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Falkland_Islands "Darwin, Falkland Islands").[\[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-111)

Argentinean A4 SkyHawk Attack on HMS *Brilliant* and HMS *Glasgow*, 12 May 1982

In the landing zone, the limitations of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences were demonstrated in the sinking of [HMS *Ardent*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Ardent_(F184) "HMS Ardent (F184)") on 21 May which was hit by nine bombs,[\[111\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-112) and [HMS *Antelope*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Antelope_(F170) "HMS Antelope (F170)") on 24 May when attempts to defuse unexploded bombs failed.[\[112\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-113) Out at sea with the carrier battle group, [MV *Atlantic Conveyor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Atlantic_Conveyor "MV Atlantic Conveyor") was struck by an air-launched Exocet on 25 May, which caused the loss of three out of four [Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Chinook_(UK_variants) "Boeing Chinook (UK variants)") and five Wessex helicopters as well as their maintenance equipment and facilities, together with runway-building equipment and tents. This was a severe blow from a logistical perspective. Twelve of her crew members were killed.[\[113\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-114)

Also lost on 25 May was [HMS *Coventry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Coventry_(D118) "HMS Coventry (D118)"), a sister to [*Sheffield*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Sheffield_(D80) "HMS Sheffield (D80)"), whilst in company with [HMS *Broadsword*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Broadsword_(F88) "HMS Broadsword (F88)") after being ordered to act as a decoy to draw away Argentine aircraft from other ships at San Carlos Bay.[\[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-115) [HMS *Argonaut*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Argonaut_(F56) "HMS Argonaut (F56)") and [HMS *Brilliant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Brilliant_(F90) "HMS Brilliant (F90)") were moderately damaged.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:1-57) However, many British ships escaped being sunk because of limitations imposed by circumstances on Argentine pilots. To avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots released bombs at very low altitude, and hence those bomb [fuzes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuze "Fuze") did not have sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the [retarded bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarded_bomb "Retarded bomb") (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier) meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves.[\[115\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-116) The pilots would have been aware of this—but due to the high concentration required to avoid [SAMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missiles "Surface-to-air missiles"), [Anti-Aircraft Artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Aircraft_Artillery "Anti-Aircraft Artillery") (AAA), and British [Sea Harriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Sea_Harrier "BAE Sea Harrier"), many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised [retarding devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_bomb "Gravity bomb"), allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.

Thirteen bombs hit British ships without detonating.[\[116\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-117) [Lord Craig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Craig,_Baron_Craig_of_Radley "David Craig, Baron Craig of Radley"), the retired [Marshal of the Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal_of_the_Royal_Air_Force "Marshal of the Royal Air Force"), is said to have remarked: "Six better fuses \[*sic*\] and we would have lost"[\[117\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-118) although *Ardent* and *Antelope* were both lost despite the failure of bombs to explode, and *Argonaut* was out of action. The fuzes were functioning correctly, and the bombs were simply released from too low an altitude.[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Woodward-119)[\[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-120) The Argentines lost 22 aircraft in the attacks.[\[nb 2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-121)

In his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the [BBC World Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service "BBC World Service") for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a [Ministry of Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom) "Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)") official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being "fearless seekers after truth" than with the lives of British servicemen.[\[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Woodward-119) Colonel ['H'. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27H%27._Jones "'H'. Jones") levelled similar accusations against the BBC after they disclosed the impending British attack on Goose Green by 2 Para.[\[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-mid12p257-122)

On 30 May, two Super Étendards, one carrying Argentina's last remaining Exocet, escorted by four [A-4C Skyhawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk "Douglas A-4 Skyhawk") each with two 500 lb bombs, took off to attack *Invincible*.[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FreedmanUK)2005-123) Argentine intelligence had sought to determine the position of the carriers from analysis of aircraft flight routes from the task force to the islands.[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FreedmanUK)2005-123) However, the British had a standing order that all aircraft conduct a low level transit when leaving or returning to the carriers to disguise their position.[\[122\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Pook2008-124) This tactic compromised the Argentine attack, which focused on a group of escorts 40 miles south of the carrier group.[\[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Morgan2007-125) Two of the attacking Skyhawks[\[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Morgan2007-125) were shot down by [Sea Dart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_dart_missile "Sea dart missile") missiles fired by [HMS *Exeter*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Exeter_(D89) "HMS Exeter (D89)"),[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FreedmanUK)2005-123) with [HMS *Avenger*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Avenger_(F185) "HMS Avenger (F185)") claiming to have shot down the Exocet missile with her 4.5" gun (although this claim is disputed).[\[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Southby-Tailyour2014-126) No damage was caused to any British vessels.[\[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FreedmanUK)2005-123) During the war Argentina claimed to have damaged *Invincible* and continues to do so to this day,[\[125\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-127) although no evidence of any such damage has been produced or uncovered.[\[57\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:1-57)[\[126\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-128)

### San Carlos – Bomb Alley\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: San Carlos – Bomb Alley")\]

[![](inbox/assets/170px-Action_stations_Falklands_1982.JPG.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Action_stations_Falklands_1982.JPG)

During the night of 21 May, the British Amphibious Task Group under the command of Commodore [Michael Clapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Clapp "Michael Clapp") (Commodore, Amphibious Warfare – COMAW) mounted [Operation Sutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sutton "Operation Sutton"), the amphibious landing on beaches around [San Carlos Water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Carlos_Water "San Carlos Water"),[\[nb 3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-129) on the northwestern coast of [East Falkland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Falkland "East Falkland") facing onto [Falkland Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Sound "Falkland Sound"). The bay, known as *Bomb Alley* by British forces, was the scene of repeated air attacks by low-flying Argentine jets.[\[127\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-130)[\[128\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-BBC-131)

The 4,000 men of [3 Commando Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Commando_Brigade "3 Commando Brigade") were put ashore as follows: [2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Battalion,_Parachute_Regiment "2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment") (2 Para) from the [RORO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RORO "RORO") ferry *[Norland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norland_(ferry) "Norland (ferry)")* and [40 Commando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40_Commando "40 Commando") [Royal Marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Marines "Royal Marines") from the amphibious ship [HMS *Fearless*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Fearless_(L10) "HMS Fearless (L10)") were landed at San Carlos (Blue Beach), [3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Battalion,_Parachute_Regiment "3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment") (3 Para) from the amphibious ship [HMS *Intrepid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Intrepid_(L11) "HMS Intrepid (L11)") was landed at [Port San Carlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_San_Carlos "Port San Carlos") (Green Beach) and [45 Commando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45_Commando "45 Commando") from [RFA *Stromness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Stromness_(A344) "RFA Stromness (A344)") was landed at [Ajax Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_Bay "Ajax Bay") (Red Beach).[\[129\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-mid12p2092-132) Notably, the waves of eight [LCUs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Craft_Utility "Landing Craft Utility") and eight [LCVPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCVP_(United_Kingdom)#LCVP_Mk2 "LCVP (United Kingdom)") were led by Major [Ewen Southby-Tailyour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewen_Southby-Tailyour "Ewen Southby-Tailyour"), who had commanded the Falklands detachment NP8901 from March 1978 to 1979. [42 Commando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_Commando "42 Commando") on the ocean liner [SS *Canberra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Canberra "SS Canberra") was a tactical reserve. Units from the [Royal Artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Artillery "Royal Artillery"), [Royal Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Engineers "Royal Engineers"), etc. and armoured reconnaissance vehicles were also put ashore with the landing craft, the [Round Table class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_Table_class_landing_ship_logistics "Round Table class landing ship logistics") [LSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Ship_Logistics "Landing Ship Logistics") and [mexeflote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexeflote "Mexeflote") barges. [Rapier missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapier_missile "Rapier missile") launchers were carried as underslung loads of [Sea Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Sea_King "Westland Sea King") for rapid deployment.

By dawn the next day, they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations. From there, [Brigadier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier "Brigadier") [Julian Thompson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Thompson_(Royal_Marines_officer) "Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)")'s plan was to capture [Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin,_Falkland_Islands "Darwin, Falkland Islands") and [Goose Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose_Green "Goose Green") before turning towards Port Stanley. Now, with the British troops on the ground, the [South Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Air_Force "South Air Force") (Argentina) began the night bombing campaign against them using [Canberra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Electric_Canberra "English Electric Canberra") bomber planes until the last day of the war (14 June).

### Goose Green\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Goose Green")\]

[![](inbox/assets/330px-Land.ops.2.en.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Land.ops.2.en.svg)

Infantry deployment in East Falklands after landing in San Carlos

From early on 27 May until 28 May, 2 Para approached and attacked Darwin and Goose Green, which was held by the Argentine 12th Infantry Regiment. 2 Para’s 500 men had naval gunfire support from HMS Arrow\[85\] and artillery support from 8 Commando Battery and the Royal Artillery. After a tough struggle that lasted all night and into the next day, the British won the battle; in all, 18 British and 47 Argentine soldiers were killed. A total of 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the *Condor* airfield) were taken prisoner.

The BBC announced the taking of Goose Green on the [BBC World Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service "BBC World Service") before it had actually happened. It was during this attack that [Lieutenant Colonel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel_(United_Kingdom) "Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)") [H. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Jones "H. Jones"), the commanding officer of 2 Para, was killed at the head of his battalion while charging into the well-prepared Argentine positions. He was posthumously awarded the [Victoria Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross "Victoria Cross").

With the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way, British forces were now able to break out of the San Carlos beachhead. On 27 May, men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a [loaded march](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_march "Loaded march") across [East Falkland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Falkland "East Falkland") towards the coastal settlement of [Teal Inlet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teal_Inlet "Teal Inlet").

### Special forces on Mount Kent\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Special forces on Mount Kent")\]

Meanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to [Mount Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kent "Mount Kent").[\[nb 4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-133) Unknown to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with [Blowpipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowpipe_(missile) "Blowpipe (missile)") surface-to-air missiles and [commandos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando "Commando") (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to [Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley,_Falkland_Islands "Stanley, Falkland Islands"). This operation was known as *Autoimpuesta* ("Self-imposed").

For the next week, the SAS and the [Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Leader_Training_Cadre "Mountain Leader Training Cadre") (M&AWC) of [3 Commando Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Commando_Brigade "3 Commando Brigade") waged intense patrol battles with patrols of the volunteers' 602nd Commando Company under Major [Aldo Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldo_Rico "Aldo Rico"), normally second in Command of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment. Throughout 30 May, Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Mount Kent. One of them, Harrier *XZ963*, flown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pook—in responding to a call for help from D Squadron, attacked Mount Kent's eastern lower slopes, which led to its loss through small-arms fire. Pook was subsequently awarded the [Distinguished Flying Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_Kingdom) "Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)").[\[130\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-134) On 31 May, the M&AWC defeated Argentine Special Forces at the [skirmish at Top Malo House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirmish_at_Top_Malo_House "Skirmish at Top Malo House"). A 13-strong Argentine Army Commando detachment (Captain José Vercesi's 1st Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) found itself trapped in a small shepherd's house at Top Malo. The Argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed 200 metres (700 ft) from the burning house. Completely surrounded, they fought 19 M&AWC marines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until, with their ammunition almost exhausted, they elected to surrender.

Three Cadre members were badly wounded. On the Argentine side, there were two dead, including Lieutenant Ernesto Espinoza and Sergeant Mateo Sbert (who were posthumously decorated for their bravery). Only five Argentines were left unscathed. As the British mopped up Top Malo House, Lieutenant Fraser Haddow's M&AWC patrol came down from Malo Hill, brandishing a large [Union Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Flag "Union Flag"). One wounded Argentine soldier, Lieutenant Horacio Losito, commented that their escape route would have taken them through Haddow's position.

601st Commando tried to move forward to rescue 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain. Spotted by 42 Commando, they were engaged with [L16 81mm mortars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L16_81mm_mortar "L16 81mm mortar") and forced to withdraw to Two Sisters mountain. The leader of 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain realised his position had become untenable and after conferring with fellow officers ordered a withdrawal.[\[131\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-135)

The Argentine operation also saw the extensive use of helicopter support to position and extract patrols; the [601st Combat Aviation Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/601_Assault_Helicopter_Battalion "601 Assault Helicopter Battalion") also suffered casualties. At about 11:00 am on 30 May, an [Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C3%A9rospatiale_SA_330_Puma "Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma") helicopter was brought down by a shoulder-launched [FIM-92 Stinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger "FIM-92 Stinger") [surface-to-air missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile "Surface-to-air missile") (SAM) fired by the SAS in the vicinity of Mount Kent. Six [Argentine National Gendarmerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_National_Gendarmerie "Argentine National Gendarmerie") Special Forces were killed and eight more wounded in the crash.[\[132\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-136)

As Brigadier Thompson commented, "It was fortunate that I had ignored the views expressed by [Northwood HQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwood_HQ "Northwood HQ") that reconnaissance of Mount Kent before insertion of 42 Commando was superfluous. Had D Squadron not been there, the Argentine Special Forces would have caught the Commando before de-planing and, in the darkness and confusion on a strange landing zone, inflicted heavy casualties on men and helicopters."[\[133\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-NoPicnic-137)

### Bluff Cove and Fitzroy\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Bluff Cove and Fitzroy")\]

By 1 June, with the arrival of a further 5,000 British troops of the 5th Infantry Brigade, the new British divisional commander, Major General [Jeremy Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Moore "Jeremy Moore") RM, had sufficient force to start planning an offensive against [Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley,_Falkland_Islands "Stanley, Falkland Islands"). During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the [Welsh Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Guards "Welsh Guards") on [RFA *Sir Galahad*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Sir_Galahad_(1966) "RFA Sir Galahad (1966)") and [RFA *Sir Tristram*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Sir_Tristram_(L3505) "RFA Sir Tristram (L3505)") on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander [Rick Jolly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Jolly "Rick Jolly") of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including [Simon Weston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Weston "Simon Weston").[\[134\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-138)

The Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army [Westland Scout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westland_Scout "Westland Scout") helicopters. Telephoning ahead to [Fitzroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzroy,_Falkland_Islands "Fitzroy, Falkland Islands"), they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their authority) commandeered the one remaining [RAF Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Chinook_(UK_variants) "Boeing Chinook (UK variants)") helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement on Port Pleasant) and [Bluff Cove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluff_Cove "Bluff Cove") (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).

[![](inbox/assets/330px-Stanley.falklands.war.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stanley.falklands.war.svg)

This uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with 30 miles (48 km) of indefensible positions, strung along their southern flank. Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.

Plans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the [Landing Ship Logistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Ship_Logistics "Landing Ship Logistics") (LSL) *Sir Tristram* and the [landing platform dock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_transport_dock "Amphibious transport dock") (LPD) *Intrepid* on the night of 5 June. *Intrepid* was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of *Sir Tristram* as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which *Sir Tristram* would be left to unload using a [Mexeflote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexeflote "Mexeflote") (a powered raft) for as long as it took to finish.

Political pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore [Michael Clapp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Clapp "Michael Clapp") to alter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable beaches to land on, *Intrepid*'s [landing craft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_craft "Landing craft") would need to accompany them to unload. A complicated operation across several nights with *Intrepid* and her sister ship [*Fearless*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Fearless_(L10) "HMS Fearless (L10)") sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.

The attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when *Fearless* dispatched her landing craft. *Sir Tristram* sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by *Sir Galahad* at dawn on 7 June. Anchored 1,200 feet (370 m) apart in Port Pleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point.

The landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point (the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine [combat engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_engineering "Combat engineering")) to their destination, a journey of around seven miles (11 km).

On *Sir Galahad*'s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day. They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship. They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board *Sir Galahad* of the [Royal Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Engineer "Royal Engineer") Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who were potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at [San Carlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Carlos,_Falkland_Islands "San Carlos, Falkland Islands") and may have been overconfident in the air defences. [Ewen Southby-Tailyour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewen_Southby-Tailyour "Ewen Southby-Tailyour") gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach; the order was ignored.[\[135\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-SouthbyTailyour1990-139)

The longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to Bluff Cove and the squabbling over how the landing was to be performed caused an enormous delay in unloading. This had disastrous consequences. Without escorts, having not yet established their air defence, and still almost fully laden, the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of Argentine [A-4 Skyhawks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk "Douglas A-4 Skyhawk").

The [disaster at Port Pleasant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluff_Cove_air_attacks "Bluff Cove air attacks") (although often known as Bluff Cove) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as TV news video footage showed [Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships.

British casualties were 48 killed and 115 wounded.[\[136\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-140) Three Argentine pilots were also killed. The air strike delayed the scheduled British ground attack on Stanley by two days.[\[137\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-141) Argentine General [Mario Menéndez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Men%C3%A9ndez "Mario Menéndez"), commander of Argentine forces in the Falklands, was told that 900 British soldiers had died. He expected that the losses would cause enemy morale to drop and the British assault to stall.

### Fall of Stanley\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Fall of Stanley")\]

Argentine prisoners of war in Port Stanley

On the night of 11 June, after several days of painstaking reconnaissance and logistic build-up, British forces launched a brigade-sized night attack against the heavily defended ring of high ground surrounding Stanley. Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the [Battle of Mount Harriet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Harriet "Battle of Mount Harriet"), [Battle of Two Sisters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Two_Sisters "Battle of Two Sisters"), and [Battle of Mount Longdon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Longdon "Battle of Mount Longdon"). Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and [friendly fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_fire "Friendly fire"), but managed to capture their objectives. The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon. British forces were bogged down by rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery and sniper fire, and ambushes. Despite this, the British continued their advance.\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]

During this battle, 14 were killed when [HMS *Glamorgan*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Glamorgan_(D19) "HMS Glamorgan (D19)"), straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line, was struck by an improvised trailer-based [Exocet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocet "Exocet") MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer [ARA *Seguí*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Segu%C3%AD_(D-25) "ARA Seguí (D-25)") by Argentine Navy technicians.[\[138\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-142) On the same day, Sergeant [Ian McKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McKay "Ian McKay") of 4 Platoon, B Company, 3 Para died in a grenade attack on an Argentine bunker; he received a posthumous [Victoria Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross "Victoria Cross") due to his actions. After a night of fierce fighting, all objectives were secured. Both sides suffered heavy losses.\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]

A pile of discarded Argentine weapons in Port Stanley

The second phase of attacks began on the night of 13 June, and the momentum of the initial assault was maintained. 2 Para, with light armour support from the [Blues and Royals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues_and_Royals "Blues and Royals"), [captured Wireless Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Wireless_Ridge "Battle of Wireless Ridge"), with the loss of 3 British and 25 Argentine lives, and the 2nd Battalion, [Scots Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_Guards "Scots Guards") captured Mount Tumbledown at the [Battle of Mount Tumbledown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mount_Tumbledown "Battle of Mount Tumbledown"), which cost 10 British and 30 Argentine lives.\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\] A simultanious special forces raid by the SAS and SBS in fast boats to attack the oil tanks in Stanley Harbour was beaten off by anti-aircraft guns.[\[139\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-143)

With the last natural defence line at [Mount Tumbledown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tumbledown "Mount Tumbledown") breached, the Argentine town defences of [Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley,_Falkland_Islands "Stanley, Falkland Islands") began to falter. In the morning gloom, one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent. Private Santiago Carrizo of the 3rd Regiment described how a platoon commander ordered them to take up positions in the houses and "if a [Kelper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelpers "Kelpers") resists, shoot him", but the entire company did nothing of the kind.[\[140\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-fn_4-144) A daylight attack on Mount William by the Gurkhas, delayed from the previous night by the fighting at Tumbledown, ended in anticlimax when the Argentinian positions were found to be deserted.[\[141\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-145)

A ceasefire was declared on 14 June and [Thatcher announced the commencement of surrender negotiations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flags_over_Port_Stanley "White flags over Port Stanley"). The commander of the Argentine garrison in Stanley, Brigade General Mario Menéndez, surrendered to Major General Jeremy Moore the same day.[\[142\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-146)

On 20 June, the British retook the [South Sandwich Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sandwich_Islands "South Sandwich Islands"), which involved accepting the surrender of the [Southern Thule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Thule "Southern Thule") Garrison at the [Corbeta Uruguay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbeta_Uruguay "Corbeta Uruguay") base, and declared hostilities over. Argentina had established Corbeta Uruguay in 1976, but prior to 1982 the United Kingdom had contested the existence of the Argentine base only through diplomatic channels.[\[143\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-147)

## Position of third-party countries\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Position of third-party countries")\]

### Commonwealth\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Commonwealth")\]

The UK received political support from member countries of the [Commonwealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations "Commonwealth of Nations"). Australia, Canada, and New Zealand withdrew their diplomats from Buenos Aires.[\[144\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Martin,_Lisa_L.-148)

The New Zealand government expelled the Argentine ambassador following the invasion. The Prime Minister, [Robert Muldoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Muldoon "Robert Muldoon"), was in London when the war broke out[\[145\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-149) and in an opinion piece published in *[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times "The Times")* he said: "The military rulers of Argentina must not be appeased … New Zealand will back Britain all the way." Broadcasting on the [BBC World Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_World_Service "BBC World Service"), he told the Falkland Islanders: "This is Rob Muldoon. We are thinking of you and we are giving our full and total support to the British Government in its endeavours to rectify this situation and get rid of the people who have invaded your country."[\[146\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-when-rob-met-maggie-150) On 20 May 1982, he announced that New Zealand would make [HMNZS *Canterbury*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMNZS_Canterbury_(F421) "HMNZS Canterbury (F421)"), a [*Leander*\-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leander-class_frigate "Leander-class frigate") [frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigate "Frigate"), available for use where the British thought fit to release a Royal Navy vessel for the Falklands.[\[147\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-151) In the House of Commons afterwards, [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher "Margaret Thatcher") said: "…the New Zealand Government and people have been absolutely magnificent in their support for this country \[and\] the Falkland Islanders, for the rule of liberty and of law".[\[146\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-when-rob-met-maggie-150)[\[148\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-152)

### France\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: France")\]

The French president, [François Mitterrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Mitterrand "François Mitterrand"), declared an embargo on French arms sales and assistance to Argentina.[\[149\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Thomson,_Mike,_2012-153) In addition, France allowed UK aircraft and warships use of its port and airfield facilities at Dakar in Senegal[\[150\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-A-Z_of_the_Falklands_War-154) and France provided [dissimilar aircraft training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissimilar_air_combat_training "Dissimilar air combat training") so that Harrier pilots could train against the French aircraft used by Argentina.[\[151\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-155) French intelligence also cooperated with Britain to prevent Argentina from obtaining more [Exocet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocet "Exocet") missiles on the international market.[\[152\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-156) In a 2002 interview, and in reference to this support, [John Nott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nott "John Nott"), the then British Defence Secretary, had described France as Britain's 'greatest ally'. In 2012, it came to light that while this support was taking place, a French technical team, employed by [Dassault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault "Dassault") and already in Argentina, remained there throughout the war despite the presidential decree. The team had provided material support to the Argentines, identifying and fixing faults in Exocet missile launchers. John Nott said he had known the French team was there but said its work was thought not to be of any importance. An adviser to the then French government denied any knowledge at the time that the technical team was there. The French [DGSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGSE "DGSE") did know the team was there as they had an informant in the team but decried any assistance the team gave: "It's bordering on an act of treason, or disobedience to an embargo". John Nott, when asked if he felt let down by the French said "If you're asking me: 'Are the French duplicitous people?' the answer is: 'Of course they are, and they always have been".[\[149\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Thomson,_Mike,_2012-153)

### United States\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: United States")\]

Declassified cables show the U.S. felt that Thatcher had not considered diplomatic options, and also feared that a protracted conflict could draw the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") on Argentina's side,[\[153\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-157) and initially tried to mediate an end to the conflict through "[shuttle diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_diplomacy "Shuttle diplomacy")". However, when Argentina refused the U.S. peace overtures, U.S. Secretary of State [Alexander Haig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Haig "Alexander Haig") announced that the United States would prohibit arms sales to Argentina and provide material support for British operations. Both houses of the [U.S. Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress "U.S. Congress") passed resolutions supporting the U.S. action siding with the United Kingdom.[\[154\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-158)

The U.S. provided the United Kingdom with 200 [Sidewinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-9_Sidewinder "AIM-9 Sidewinder") missiles for use by the Harrier jets,[\[155\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-159)[\[156\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-160) eight Stinger surface to air missile systems, [Harpoon anti-ship missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpoon_(missile) "Harpoon (missile)") and mortar bombs.[\[157\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-161) On Ascension Island, the underground fuel tanks were empty when the British Task Force arrived in mid-April 1982 and the leading assault ship, [HMS *Fearless*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Fearless_(L10) "HMS Fearless (L10)"), did not have enough fuel to dock when it arrived off Ascension. The United States diverted a supertanker to replenish the fuel tanks of ships there at anchor as well as for storage tanks on the island – approximately 2 million gallons of fuel were supplied.[\[158\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-162) The Pentagon further committed to providing additional support in the event of the war dragging on into the southern hemisphere winter: in this scenario the U.S. committed to providing tanker aircraft to support Royal Air Force missions in Europe, releasing RAF aircraft to support operations over the Falklands.[\[159\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-163)

The United States allowed the United Kingdom to use U.S. communication satellites to allow secure communications between submarines in the Southern Ocean and Naval HQ in Britain. The U.S. also passed on satellite imagery (which it publicly denied[\[160\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-164)) and weather forecast data to the British Fleet.[\[161\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-165)

President [Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") approved the Royal Navy's request to borrow a [Sea Harrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Harrier "Sea Harrier")\-capable [*Iwo Jima*\-class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwo_Jima-class_amphibious_assault_ship "Iwo Jima-class amphibious assault ship") [amphibious assault ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_assault_ship "Amphibious assault ship") (the US Navy had earmarked [USS *Guam* (LPH-9)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Guam_(LPH-9) "USS Guam (LPH-9)") for this[\[162\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-166)) if the British lost an aircraft carrier. The [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy") developed a plan to help the British man the ship with American [military contractors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_contractor "Military contractor"), likely retired sailors with knowledge of the ship's systems.[\[163\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-usni20120627-167)

### Other OAS members\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Other OAS members")\]

#### Cuba\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Cuba")\]

Argentina itself was politically backed by a number of countries in [Latin America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America") (though, notably, not [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile")). Several members of the [Non-Aligned Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement "Non-Aligned Movement") also backed Argentina's position; notably, Cuba and Nicaragua led a diplomatic effort to rally non-aligned countries from Africa and Asia towards Argentina's position. This initiative came as a surprise to Western observers, as Cuba had no diplomatic relations with Argentina's right-leaning military junta. British diplomats complained that Cuba had "cynically exploited" the crisis to pursue its normalization of relations with Latin American countries; Argentina eventually resumed relations with Cuba in 1983, followed by Brazil in 1986.[\[164\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-168)

#### Peru\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Peru")\]

[Peru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru "Peru") attempted to purchase 12 Exocet missiles from France to be delivered to Argentina, in a failed secret operation.[\[165\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-169)[\[166\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-170) Peru also openly sent "[Mirages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Mirage "Dassault Mirage"), pilots and missiles" to Argentina during the war.[\[167\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-171) Peru had earlier transferred ten Hercules transport planes to Argentina soon after the British Task Force had set sail in April 1982.[\[168\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-172) Nick van der Bijl records that, after the Argentine defeat at Goose Green, Venezuela and Guatemala offered to send paratroopers to the Falklands.[\[169\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-173)

#### Chile\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Chile")\]

At the outbreak of the war, [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile") was in negotiations with Argentina for control over the [Beagle Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle_Channel "Beagle Channel") and feared Argentina would use similar tactics to secure the channel[\[170\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:0-174) and as such, refused to support the Argentine position during the war.[\[171\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-175) As a consequence, [Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile "Chile") also gave support to the UK in the form of intelligence about the Argentine military and early warning intelligence on Argentine air movements.[\[172\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-176)[\[173\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-177) Throughout the war, Argentina was afraid of a Chilean military intervention in Patagonia and kept some of its best mountain regiments away from the Falklands near the Chilean border as a precaution.[\[174\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-178) The Chilean government also allowed the United Kingdom to requisition the refuelling vessel [RFA *Tidepool*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA_Tidepool_(A76) "RFA Tidepool (A76)"), which Chile had recently purchased and which had arrived at [Arica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arica "Arica") in Chile on 4 April. The ship left port soon afterwards, bound for [Ascension Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascension_Island "Ascension Island") through the [Panama Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Canal "Panama Canal") and stopping at [Curaçao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cura%C3%A7ao "Curaçao") en route.[\[175\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-179)[\[176\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-180)[\[177\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-181)

### Soviet Union\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Soviet Union")\]

The Soviet Union described the Falklands as "a disputed territory," recognising Argentina's ambitions over the islands and called for restraint on all sides. They were adamant to veto any resolution in the UN Security Council if tabled by the United Kingdom.[\[170\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:0-174) The Soviet Union did mount some clandestine logistics operations in favour of the Argentinians.[\[178\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-brazil-ussr-182) Soviet media frequently criticised the UK and US during the war. Days after the invasion by the Argentinian forces, the Soviets launched additional intelligence satellites into low Earth orbit covering the southern Atlantic Ocean. There are conflicting reports on whether Soviet ocean surveillance data might have played a role in the sinking of [HMS *Sheffield*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Sheffield_(D80) "HMS Sheffield (D80)") and [HMS *Coventry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Coventry_(D118) "HMS Coventry (D118)").[\[179\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-183)[\[180\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-184)[\[181\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-185)

Spain's position was one of ambiguity, underpinning the basic dilemma of the Spanish foreign policy regarding the articulation of relationships with Latin America and the European Communities.[\[182\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-186) On 2 April 1982, the [Council of Ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_(Spain) "Council of Ministers (Spain)") issued an official note defending principles of decolonisation and against the use of force.[\[183\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBarb%C3%A91994228-187) Spain abstained in the vote of the [United Nations Security Council Resolution 502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_502 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 502"), a position justified by the Spanish representative before the UN [Jaime de Piniés](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_de_Pini%C3%A9s "Jaime de Piniés") on the basis that the resolution made no mention to the underlying problem of decolonisation.[\[183\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBarb%C3%A91994228-187) The Spanish stance throughout the conflict contrasted with those of the countries in its immediate vicinity (EEC members and Portugal).[\[184\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBarb%C3%A91994222%E2%80%93223-188)

### Other countries\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Other countries")\]

#### EEC\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: EEC")\]

The [EEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community "European Economic Community") provided economic support by imposing economic sanctions on Argentina.

#### Republic of Ireland\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Republic of Ireland")\]

Ireland's position altered during the war. As a rotating member of the United Nations Security Council, it supported Resolution 502. However, on 4 May the [Fianna Fáil government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_22nd_D%C3%A1il "Government of the 22nd Dáil") led by [Charles Haughey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Haughey "Charles Haughey") decided to oppose EEC sanctions and called for a ceasefire. Haughey justified this as complying with [Irish neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_neutrality "Irish neutrality"). Historians have suggested it was an opportunistic appeal to anti-British sentiment and reaction to Haughey's being sidelined during the [1981 republican hunger strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Irish_hunger_strike "1981 Irish hunger strike"). The strain to [British–Irish relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations "Ireland–United Kingdom relations") eased when Haughey's government fell [in November 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_1982_Irish_general_election "November 1982 Irish general election").[\[185\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-189)[\[186\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-190)[\[187\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-191)

#### Israel\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Israel")\]

According to the book *Operation Israel*, advisers from [Israel Aerospace Industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Aerospace_Industries "Israel Aerospace Industries") were already in Argentina and continued their work during the conflict. The book also claims that Israel sold weapons and [drop tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_tank "Drop tank") to Argentina in a secret operation via Peru.[\[188\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-192)[\[189\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-193)

#### Sierra Leone\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Sierra Leone")\]

The Sierra Leonian government allowed British task force ships to refuel at [Freetown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freetown "Freetown").[\[190\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-194)

#### The Gambia\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: The Gambia")\]

#### Libya\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Libya")\]

Through [Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Arab_Jamahiriya "Libyan Arab Jamahiriya"), under [Muammar Gaddafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muammar_Gaddafi "Muammar Gaddafi"), Argentina received 20 launchers and 60 [SA-7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA-7 "SA-7") missiles (which Argentina later described as "not effective"), as well as machine guns, mortars and mines; all in all, the load of four trips of two [Boeing 707s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_707 "Boeing 707") of the AAF, refuelled in [Recife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife "Recife") with the knowledge and consent of the Brazilian government.[\[191\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-195)

#### South Africa\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=41 "Edit section: South Africa")\]

The UK had terminated the [Simonstown Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonstown_Agreement "Simonstown Agreement") in 1975, thereby effectively denying the Royal Navy access to ports in [South Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa "South Africa"), and instead forcing them to use Ascension Island as a staging post.[\[192\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-196)

### Red Cross Box\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=43 "Edit section: Red Cross Box")\]

[![](inbox/assets/220px-HMS_Hecla_1982_Gibraltar.jpg.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HMS_Hecla_1982_Gibraltar.jpg)

*Hecla* at HM Naval Base Gibraltar, during conversion to a hospital ship for service during the Falklands War

Before British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side. This area, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross Box ([48°30′S 53°45′W﻿ / ﻿48.500°S 53.750°W](https://geohack.toolforge.org/geohack.php?pagename=Falklands_War&params=48_30_S_53_45_W_scale:10000000)), about 45 miles (72 km) north of [Falkland Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Sound "Falkland Sound").[\[207\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-211) Ultimately, the British stationed four ships ([HMS *Hydra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hydra_(A144) "HMS Hydra (A144)"), [HMS *Hecla*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Hecla_(A133) "HMS Hecla (A133)") and [HMS *Herald*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Herald_(H138) "HMS Herald (H138)") and the primary hospital ship [SS *Uganda*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Uganda_(1952) "SS Uganda (1952)")) within the box,[\[208\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-212) while the Argentines stationed three ([ARA *Almirante Irízar*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Almirante_Ir%C3%ADzar_(Q-5) "ARA Almirante Irízar (Q-5)"), [ARA *Bahía Paraíso*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Bah%C3%ADa_Para%C3%ADso_(B-1) "ARA Bahía Paraíso (B-1)") and [*Puerto Deseado*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_Puerto_Deseado_(Q-20) "ARA Puerto Deseado (Q-20)")).

The hospital ships were non-warships converted to serve as hospital ships.[\[209\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-213) The three British naval vessels were survey vessels and *Uganda* was a passenger liner. *Almirante Irizar* was an icebreaker, *Bahia Paraiso* was an Antarctic supply transport and *Puerto Deseado* was a survey ship. The British and Argentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between the hospital ships. For example, the *Uganda* on four occasions transferred patients to an Argentine hospital ship.[\[210\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-214) *Hydra* worked with *Hecla* and *Herald* to take casualties from *Uganda* to Montevideo, Uruguay, where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances met them. [RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force "Royal Air Force") [VC10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC10 "VC10") aircraft then flew the casualties to the UK for transfer to the [Princess Alexandra Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Princess_Alexandra_Hospital "RAF Princess Alexandra Hospital") at [RAF Wroughton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Wroughton "RAF Wroughton"), near [Swindon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swindon "Swindon").[\[211\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-215)

Throughout the conflict officials of the [International Committee of the Red Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross "International Committee of the Red Cross") (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the [Geneva Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions "Geneva Conventions"). Argentine naval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of the [River Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%ADo_de_la_Plata "Río de la Plata").\[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*\]

## Aftermath\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=44 "Edit section: Aftermath")\]

This brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides the considerable casualty rate and large [materiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materiel "Materiel") loss, especially of shipping and aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides.

In the United Kingdom, [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher "Margaret Thatcher")'s popularity increased. The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)") government, who had been trailing behind the [SDP–Liberal Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDP%E2%80%93Liberal_Alliance "SDP–Liberal Alliance") in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began, but following the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win [the following year's general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_United_Kingdom_general_election "1983 United Kingdom general election") by a landslide.[\[212\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-217) Subsequently, Defence Secretary Nott's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.

The islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983, their quality of life was improved by investments the UK made after the war and by the economic liberalisation that had been stalled through fear of angering Argentina. In 1985, a [new constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Falkland_Islands "Constitution of the Falkland Islands") was enacted promoting self-government, which has continued to [devolve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution "Devolution") power to the islanders.

In Argentina, defeat in the Falklands War meant that a [possible war with Chile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle_conflict "Beagle conflict") was avoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the [1983 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Argentine_general_election "1983 Argentine general election"), the first free general election since 1973. It also had a major social impact, destroying the military's image as the "moral reserve of the nation" that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.

A detailed study[\[213\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-218) of 21,432 British veterans of the war commissioned by the UK Ministry of Defence found that between 1982 and 2012 only 95 had died from "intentional self-harm and events of undetermined intent (suicides and open verdict deaths)", a proportion lower than would be expected within the general population over the same period.[\[214\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-219) However, a study of British combat veterans conducted five years after the conflict, found that half of the sample group had suffered some symptoms of [Post-traumatic Stress Disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_Stress_Disorder "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder") (PTSD), while 22% were assessed to have the complete syndrome.[\[215\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-220)

In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, the British government embarked on a long-term policy of providing the islands with a viable military garrison, known informally as "Fortress Falklands". Initially, an aircraft carrier was kept in the area until the runway at Stanley Airport could be improved to take conventional RAF fighters. A permanent military complex with a runway designed to take long-haul airliners was constructed in the south of East Falkland, [RAF Mount Pleasant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Mount_Pleasant "RAF Mount Pleasant"), which opened in 1985; an associated deep-water port at [Mare Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Harbour "Mare Harbour") was also constructed. A small military outpost was established at [King Edward Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Edward_Point "King Edward Point") on South Georgia, but it was closed in 2001.[\[216\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-221)

### Military analysis\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Military analysis")\]

Militarily, the Falklands conflict remains one of the largest air-naval combat operations between modern forces since the end of the Second World War. As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. The most significant "lessons learned" include: the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and reconfirmation of the importance of tactical air power, including the use of helicopters.

In 1986, the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") broadcast the *[Horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_(BBC_TV_series) "Horizon (BBC TV series)")* programme, *In the Wake of HMS Sheffield*, which discussed lessons learned from the conflict, and measures since taken to implement them, such as incorporating greater [stealth capabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_ship "Stealth ship") and providing better [close-in weapon systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-in_weapon_system "Close-in weapon system") for the Fleet. The principal British military responses to the Falklands War were the measures adopted in the [December 1982 Defence White Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981_Defence_White_Paper#Impact_of_the_Falklands_War:_December_1982_White_Paper "1981 Defence White Paper").[\[217\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-222)

### Memorials\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=47 "Edit section: Memorials")\]

[![](inbox/assets/170px-1982_Liberation_Memorial_in_Stanley_%285612271774%29.jpg.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1982_Liberation_Memorial_in_Stanley_(5612271774).jpg)

There are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the [1982 Liberation Memorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Liberation_Memorial "1982 Liberation Memorial"), unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war. It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley, overlooking [Stanley Harbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Harbour "Stanley Harbour"). The Memorial was funded entirely by the Islanders and is inscribed with the words "In Memory of Those Who Liberated Us".[\[218\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FITB-223)

In addition to memorials on the islands, there is a memorial in the crypt of [St Paul's Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral "St Paul's Cathedral"), London to the British war dead.[\[219\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-224) The [Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falkland_Islands_Memorial_Chapel "Falkland Islands Memorial Chapel") at [Pangbourne College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangbourne_College "Pangbourne College") was opened in March 2000 as a commemoration of the lives and sacrifice of all those who served and died in the South Atlantic in 1982.[\[220\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-225) In Argentina, there is a memorial at [Plaza San Martín](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza_San_Mart%C3%ADn_(Buenos_Aires) "Plaza San Martín (Buenos Aires)") in Buenos Aires,[\[221\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-226) [another one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Malvinas,_por_siempre_argentinas_1.jpg "File:Malvinas, por siempre argentinas 1.jpg") in [Rosario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario,_Santa_Fe "Rosario, Santa Fe"), and [a third one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UshuaiaFalklandsWarVictimsMonument.jpg "File:UshuaiaFalklandsWarVictimsMonument.jpg") in [Ushuaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushuaia "Ushuaia").

During the war, British dead were put into plastic [body bags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_bag "Body bag") and buried in mass graves. After the war, the bodies were recovered; 14 were reburied at [Blue Beach Military Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Beach_Military_Cemetery_at_San_Carlos "Blue Beach Military Cemetery at San Carlos") and 64 were returned to the UK.

Many of the Argentine dead are buried in the [Argentine Military Cemetery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_Military_Cemetery "Argentine Military Cemetery") 2 km North East of the small settlement of Darwin, which is approx. 82 km West of Stanley. The government of Argentina declined an offer by the UK to have the bodies repatriated to Argentina.[\[222\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-227)

### Minefields\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=48 "Edit section: Minefields")\]

[![](inbox/assets/220px-Falklands-Minefield.JPG.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Falklands-Minefield.JPG)

In 2011 there were 113 uncleared minefields plus [unexploded ordnance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unexploded_ordnance "Unexploded ordnance") (UXOs) covering an area of 13 km2 (3,200 acres) on the Falkland Islands. Of this area, 5.5 km2 (1,400 acres) on the Murrell Peninsula were classified as being "suspected minefields"—the area had been heavily pastured for 25 years without incident. It was estimated that these minefields had 20,000 anti-personnel mines and 5,000 anti-tank mines.

The UK reported six military personnel injured by mines or UXO in 1982, then two more in 1983. Most military accidents took place in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, while clearing minefields or trying to establish the extent of minefield perimeters, particularly where no detailed records existed. No civilian mine casualties have ever occurred on the islands, and no human casualties from mines or UXO have been reported since 1984.

On 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields, which represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands "present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands," and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them. However, the British Government, in accordance with its commitments under the [Mine Ban Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mine_Ban_Treaty "Mine Ban Treaty") had a commitment to clear the mines by the end of 2019.[\[223\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-228)[\[224\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-229)

In May 2012, it was announced that 3.7 km2 (1.4 sq mi) of Stanley Common (which lies between the Stanley – Mount Pleasant road and the shoreline) was made safe and had been opened to the public, opening up a 3 km (1.9 mi) stretch of coastline and a further two kilometres of shoreline along Mullet's Creek.[\[225\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-230)

In November 2020, it was declared that the Falkland islands were now free of all landmines. A celebration of the event took place on the weekend of 14 November where the final landmine was detonated.[\[226\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-231)

## Press and publicity\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=49 "Edit section: Press and publicity")\]

### Argentina\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=50 "Edit section: Argentina")\]

[![](inbox/assets/220px-Gentemayo1982.jpg.jpeg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gentemayo1982.jpg)

*Gente*'s "Estamos ganando" headline ("We're winning")

Selected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war. Back in Buenos Aires, newspapers and magazines reported on "the heroic actions of the largely conscript army and its successes".[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Jimmy_Burns,1987-20)

Officers from the intelligence services were attached to the newspapers and 'leaked' information corroborating the official communiqués from the government. The glossy magazines *Gente* and *[Siete Días](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Siete_D%C3%ADas&action=edit&redlink=1 "Siete Días (page does not exist)")* swelled to 60 pages with colour photographs of British warships in flames—many of them faked—and bogus eyewitness reports of the Argentine commandos' guerrilla war on South Georgia (6 May) and an already dead Pucará pilot's attack on HMS *Hermes*[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Jimmy_Burns,1987-20) (Lt. Daniel Antonio Jukic had been killed at Goose Green during a British air strike on 1 May). Most of the faked photos actually came from the tabloid press. One of the best remembered headlines was "Estamos ganando" ("We're winning") from the magazine *Gente*, that would later use variations of it.[\[227\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-232)

The Argentine troops on the Falkland Islands could read *Gaceta Argentina*—a newspaper intended to boost morale among the servicemen. Some of its untruths could easily be unveiled by the soldiers who recovered corpses.[\[228\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-233)

The *Malvinas cause* united the Argentines in a patriotic atmosphere that protected the junta from critics, and even opponents of the military government supported Galtieri; [Ernesto Sabato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Sabato "Ernesto Sabato") said:

> In Argentina, it is not a military dictatorship that is fighting. It is the whole people, her women, her children, her old people, regardless of their political persuasion. Opponents to the regime like myself are fighting for our dignity, fighting to extricate the last vestiges of colonialism. Don't be mistaken, Europe, it is not a dictatorship that is fighting for the Malvinas; it is the whole nation.[\[229\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-234)

In the Argentine press, false reports that HMS *Hermes* was sunk and HMS *Invincible* had been damaged were circulated after the weekly magazines *Gente* and *La Semana* had received information of naval action from an air force officer in the president's office.[\[230\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-235) On 30 April 1982 the Argentine magazine *Tal Cual* showed Prime Minister Thatcher with an eyepatch and the text: *Pirate, witch and assassin. Guilty!*[\[231\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-236) Three British reporters sent to Argentina to cover the war from the Argentine perspective were jailed until the end of the war.[\[232\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-237) The *[Madres de Plaza de Mayo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothers_of_the_Plaza_de_Mayo "Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo")* were even exposed to [death threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat "Death threat") from ordinary people.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Jimmy_Burns,1987-20)

### United Kingdom\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=51 "Edit section: United Kingdom")\]

[![](inbox/assets/220px-The_Sun_%28Gotcha%29.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Sun_(Gotcha).png)

Seventeen newspaper reporters, two photographers, two radio reporters and three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war. The Newspaper Publishers' Association selected them from among 160 applicants, excluding foreign media. The hasty selection resulted in the inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II's son [Prince Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York "Prince Andrew, Duke of York"), who was serving in the conflict.[\[233\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-238) The Prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including [Exocet missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocet_missile "Exocet missile") decoy and casualty evacuation.[\[234\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-239)

Merchant vessels had the civilian [Inmarsat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inmarsat "Inmarsat") uplink, which enabled written [telex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletypewriter_message "Teletypewriter message") and voice report transmissions via satellite. [SS *Canberra*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Canberra "SS Canberra") had a [facsimile machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax "Fax") that was used to upload 202 pictures from the South Atlantic over the course of the war. The Royal Navy leased bandwidth on the U.S. [Defense Satellite Communications System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Satellite_Communications_System "Defense Satellite Communications System") for worldwide communications. Television demands a thousand times the data rate of telephone, but the Ministry of Defence was unsuccessful in convincing the U.S. to allocate more bandwidth.[\[235\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman-240)

TV producers suspected that the enquiry was half-hearted; since the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War") television pictures of casualties and traumatised soldiers were recognised as having negative propaganda value. However, the technology only allowed uploading a single frame per 20 minutes—and only if the military satellites were allocated 100% to television transmissions. Videotapes were shipped to Ascension Island, where a broadband satellite uplink was available, resulting in TV coverage being delayed by three weeks.[\[235\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman-240)

The press was very dependent on the Royal Navy, and was [censored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship "Censorship") on site. Many reporters in the UK knew more about the war than those with the Task Force.[\[235\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Freedman-240) Ministry of Defence press briefings in London were characterised by the restrained dictation-speed delivery of its spokesman, [Ian McDonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McDonald_(civil_servant) "Ian McDonald (civil servant)").[\[236\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-241)

The Royal Navy expected [Fleet Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Street "Fleet Street") to conduct a Second World War-style positive news campaign[\[237\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-242) but the majority of the British media, especially the BBC, reported the war in a neutral fashion.[\[238\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-243) These reporters referred to "the British troops" and "the Argentinian troops" instead of "our lads" and the "Argies".[\[239\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-244) The two main tabloid papers presented opposing viewpoints: *[The Daily Mirror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mirror "Daily Mirror")* was decidedly anti-war, whilst *[The Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom) "The Sun (United Kingdom)")* became well known for headlines such as "Stick It Up Your Junta!," which, along with the reporting in other tabloids,[\[240\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Dawn-245) led to accusations of xenophobia[\[240\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Dawn-245)[\[241\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Harris-246)[\[242\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-McKenzie-247) and [jingoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingoism "Jingoism").[\[241\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Harris-246)[\[242\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-McKenzie-247)[\[243\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-248)[\[244\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-249) *The Sun* was criticised for its "Gotcha" headline following the sinking of the [ARA *General Belgrano*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARA_General_Belgrano "ARA General Belgrano").[\[245\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-250)[\[246\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-251)[\[247\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-252)

## Cultural impact\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Falklands_War&action=edit&section=52 "Edit section: Cultural impact")\]

There were wide-ranging influences on popular culture in both the UK and Argentina, from the immediate postwar period to the present. The Argentine writer [Jorge Luis Borges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges "Jorge Luis Borges") described the war as "a fight between two bald men over a comb".[\[248\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-253) The words *[yomp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yomp "Yomp")* and *[Exocet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocet "Exocet")* entered the British vernacular as a result of the war. The Falklands War also provided material for theatre, film and TV drama and influenced the output of musicians. In Argentina, the military government banned the broadcasting of music in the English language, giving way to the rise of local rock musicians.[\[249\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-254)

A retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the speed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the bomb and the aircraft.

Menéndez ordered the publication of a newspaper for the troops on the Falkland Islands called *Gaceta Argentina*. It stated that one of the Mirages lost on 1 May had collided with a Sea Harrier and the Argentine pilot survived. In fact Argentine AAA at Stanley shot down the Mirage when it tried an emergency landing there. It was a blatant lie for all those Argentine servicemen who had seen the Mirage being shot down by Argentine guns and had removed the dead pilot from the crashed aeroplane. Similarly, the junta's press office in Buenos Aires informed that Lieutenant Antonio Jukic, who actually was killed in his Pucará on the ground at Goose Green, had perished in a gallant, single-handed Pucará attack on HMS *Hermes*, setting it on fire. This statement was illustrated with dramatic sketches. The men at Goose Green knew that Lieutenant Jukic had died on the ground there.  
    *Gaceta Argentina* summed up the British losses up to 25 May as: 5 warship sunk (correct number 3), 3 transport ships including SS *Canberra* (1; *Atlantic Conveyor*), 14 Sea Harriers (2 shot down & 3 accidents) and many ships damaged, including HMS *Hermes*. *Gaceta Argentina* even wrote: 'All of these details refer only to proven claims and not to estimated or unproven claims ...'."
