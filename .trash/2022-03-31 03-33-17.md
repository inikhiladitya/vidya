According to the Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 38b), the language spoken by Adam — the Bible's first human — was Aramaic.[16]

Aramaic was the language of Jesus,[17][18][19] who spoke the Galilean dialect during his public ministry, as well as the language of several sections of the Hebrew Bible, including parts of the books of Daniel and Ezra, and also the language of the Targum, the Aramaic translation of the Hebrew Bible.[20][21][22] It is also the language of the Jerusalem Talmud, Babylonian Talmud and Zohar.
