- User Data-gram Protocol is a connection-less protocol.
- Unreliable transport of segments.
  - If dropped, sender is unaware. No sequencing or acknowledgement.
- No [[windowing]], re-transmission.
- Good for audio/video streaming (less overhead, increased performance).
- E.g. YouTube video/audio streaming
