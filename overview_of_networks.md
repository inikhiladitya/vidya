title: Overview of Networks
---

- There are a lot of networks and not just computer networks.
- The purpose of these networks is to make connections between different machines.
- Network between your personal devices such as a smart watch and a smart phone over [Bluetooth](#Bluetooth) is called a [PAN](#PAN).
- There is also the typical [Wi-Fi](#Wi-Fi) network when you're connected through the wireless access point that connects out to the internet.
- Or it can also be your desktop connected to a [Hub](#Hub) which is connected to a [Switch](#Switch) that is connected to a Router and the [router](#router) ultimately connected to the internet.
- All of these networks combined are known as Converged Network.
- In the old days we had different networks for different purposes such as a [Telephone Network](#Telephone%20Network) to make [Analog Phone Calls](#Analog%20Phone%20Calls) seperate from Computer Network for digital things.
- Overtime this has merged and we now have all one network taking care of all things. (A digital network)
- Uptime is really important for these networks and people expect the network to be up 100% of the time but thats unrealistic, sometime has to be sacrificed for maintainence and other things but most networks are guaranteed uptime for 99.999% of time time (The 5 nines of availability)
- Throughout the course of the year 5 minutes of downtime allowed per year.
- Network traffic can be:
  - File sharing
  - Video chatting
  - Web surfing
  - Social media
  - Video streaming
  - Email
  - Messaging
