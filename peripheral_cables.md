/[Computer Fundamentals Hardware](#Computer%20Fundamentals%20Hardware)

Peripheral cables provide wired connectivity solution for external devices that add functionality to a PC.

They come in a couple of differnet forms, whether we're talking about Peripheral and Network Cables:

- Standard cables contain one or more copper wires to transmit electricity.
- Fiber optic cables contain glass or plastic fibers to reflect light wavelengths.
- Cable length determines signal strength and quality, to rectify this, we use a repeater to make the signal strong again.

## Cable Transmission Types

#### Serial Transmission

- Transmits one bit at a time down the copper wire
- More common than parallel (older)
- Faster transmission rates
- Universal Serial Bus ([USB](#USB))
- Serial ATA([SATA](#SATA))

#### Parallel Transmission

- Transmits multiple bits simultaneously through adjacent copper wires.
- Older cable type.
- Electrical signal interference from adjacent wires.
- Smaller transmission distance than Serial.
- [PATA](#PATA)
- [SCSI](#SCSI)

#### Video cables

- [VGA](#VGA)
- Digital Video Interface, Video only [DVI-D](#DVI-D), [DVI-A](#DVI-A), [DVI-I](#DVI-I)
- [DisplayPort](#DisplayPort)
- [HDMI](#HDMI)

#### Mutlipurpose Cables

- [Plenum](#Plenum) cabling - used in and near air ventilation systems, if it burns it releases lowest amount of smoke/toxins.
- [Non-Plenum](#Non-Plenum) cabling cannot be used in raised floors, ceilings or walls.
- Thunderbolt - supports both PCI Express + DisplayPort, allows device [Daisy-Chaining](#Daisy-Chaining) such as monitors and storage drives.
- Lightning - Allows connectivity between Apple iOS devices and peripherals.
