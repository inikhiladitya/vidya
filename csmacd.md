- [Ethernet](#Ethernet) devices transmit based on a principle called Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detect or CSMA/CD
- Carrier Sense
  - Listen to the wire, verify it is not busy
- Multiple Access
  - All devices have access at any time
- Collision Detect
  - If two deviecs transmit at the same time, a collision occurs
  - Back off, wait a random time and try again
