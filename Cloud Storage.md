title: Cloud Storage

- Storage available over a network (such as through public cloud: AWS, Google Cloud, etc)
- We're not concerned with disk interfaces, the configuration, syncing, cables, thats the provider's responsibility

### Considerations

- Redundant internet connections
- Automatic synchronization
- Server-side encryption of data at rest
- Data sovereignty
