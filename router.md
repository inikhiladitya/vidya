A device that connects two different networks together and intelligently forwards traffic to and from a network based on its logical address([[IP Address]])

Modern routers use [[IP Address]]es to determine the routing of network traffic, although there are other routing protocols as well.

- Layer 3 device used to connect multiple networks together
- Making forwarding decisions based on logical network address information
  - Such as using [[IP Address]]es ([[IPv4]] or [[IPv6]])
- Routers are typically more feature rich and support a broader range of interface types than multilayer [[Switch]]es

- Each port is a separate [[collision domain]]
- Each port is a separate [[broadcast domain]]
