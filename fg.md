`fg` command moves a [background job](#background%20process) in the current shell environment into the [foreground](#foreground%20process). Use the job ID parameter to indicate a specific job to be run in the foreground. If this parameter is not supplied, the `fg` command uses the job most recently suspended, placed in the background, or run as a background job.

`fg %JobID`
