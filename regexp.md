title: REGEXP
---

- `areas:` [[SQL]]

[MySQL](#MySQL) supports another type of pattern matching operation([LIKE](#LIKE)) based on the [regular expression](#regular%20expression)s that is REGEXP operator

- It provide a powerful and flexible pattern match that can help us implement power search utilities for our database systems.
- REGEXP is the operator used when performing regular expression pattern matches. [RLIKE](#RLIKE) is the synonym.
- It also supports a number of metacharacters which allow more flexibility and control when performing pattern matching.
- The backslash is used as an escape character. It’s only considered in the pattern match if double backslashes have used.
- Not case sensitive.

<!-- end list -->

    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name LIKE '%field%'

Instead of using [LIKE](#LIKE) we can use REGEXP such as:

    WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field'

### Patterns

- caret(^) matches beginning of the string
- dollar sign($) matches end of the string
- p1|p2|p3, pipe matches any of the patterns p1, p2, or p3; Alternation
- \[\] - Any character listed between the square brackets
  - `WHERE last_name REGEXP '[gim]e'` searches for last name that ends in `e` but has any of the characters mentioned in the brackets before it.
  - `'[a-h]e'` will look for all characters from a to h before e
