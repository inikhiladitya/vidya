- A <span class="underline">Terminal Emulator</span> is a crucial part of any Linux system because it basically allows you to access the system through a shell. It is a GUI for a console.
- A [shell](#shell) is a program that takes commands from the user and gives them to the operating system's kernel to execute. It's also called the command interpreter. The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.
- Linux is a case-sensitive operating system.
- The default shell in most distros is [Bash](#Bash), a shell interprets the commands and pass them on to the kernel for execution.
- Run `ps` command to display the currently-running processes.

> A console is generally a terminal in the physical sense that is by some definition the primary terminal directly connected to a machine. The console appears to the operating system as a (kernel-implemented) terminals. On some systems, such as Linux and FreeBSD, the console appears as several terminals (ttys) (special key combinations switch between these terminals); just to confuse matters, the name given to each particular terminal can be “console”, ”virtual console”, ”virtual terminal”, and other variations.—via [What is the difference between Terminal, Console, Shell, and Command Line? - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/506510/what-is-the-difference-between-terminal-console-shell-and-command-line)

- Modern Linux systems provide virtual consoles (which you can access through `Ctrl + Alt + F1 ... F8`) out of which one was logged in when the user logged in from the GUI.
