title: Collision Domains on Hub
---

- [Hub](#Hub)s were used to connect multiple network segments together
- Each [LAN](#LAN) segment becomes a separate [collsion domain](#Collision%20Domains)
- As the network gets larger in which a [Hub](#Hub) is being utilized to connect all the machines, the network will get more chaotic as [Hub](#Hub) don't break up [Collision Domains](#Collision%20Domains), it'll be treated as one large collision domain.
- To deal with this issue a [Bridge](#Bridge) needs to be introduced to the network.
