# [Tang ping - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_ping)

***Tang ping*** ([Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language "Chinese language"): 躺平; [pinyin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): *tǎng píng*; [lit.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation") '**lying flat'**) is a [lifestyle](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_(social_sciences) "Lifestyle (social sciences)") and [social protest](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_protest "Social protest") movement in [China](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") beginning in April 2021. It is a rejection of societal pressures to [overwork](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwork "Overwork"), such as in the [996 working hour system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/996_working_hour_system "996 working hour system"), which is often regarded as a [rat race](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race "Rat race") with ever [diminishing returns](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns "Diminishing returns").[\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-BBC-1)[\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-4) Those who participate in *tang ping* instead choose to "lie down flat and get over the beatings" via a low-desire, more indifferent attitude towards life.

Novelist Liao Zenghu described "lying flat" as a [resistance movement](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement "Resistance movement"),[\[5\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-5) and *The New York Times* called it part of a nascent Chinese [counterculture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture "Counterculture").[\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-NYTChen-6) It has also been compared to the [Great Resignation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Resignation "Great Resignation"), a surge of resignations that began in the United States and much of the [Western world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world "Western world") at roughly the same time.[\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-7)[\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-scmp-oct-2021-8)[\[9\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-9) The National Language Resources Monitoring and Research Center, an institution affiliated to Education Ministry of China, listed the word as one of the 10 most popular memes for 2021 in Chinese Internet. Chinese search engine Sogou also listed the word at the top of its list of most trending memes for 2021.[\[10\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-10)

Unlike the *[hikikomori](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori "Hikikomori")* in [Japan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan") who are socially withdrawn, these young Chinese people who subscribe to "lying flat" are not [socially isolated](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_isolation "Social isolation"), but merely choose to lower their professional and economic ambitions and simplify their goals, still being fiscally productive for their own essential needs, and prioritize [psychological health](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_health "Psychological health") over [economic materialism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_materialism "Economic materialism").[\[11\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-SixthTone-11)

## Origin[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tang_ping&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Origin")

The movement began in April 2021 with a post by Luo Huazhong (username "Kind-Hearted Traveler") on the [internet forum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum "Internet forum") [Baidu Tieba](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baidu_Tieba "Baidu Tieba"), in which he discussed his reasons for living a low-key, [minimalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living "Simple living") lifestyle. In 2016, 26-year-old Luo quit his factory job because it made him feel empty. He then [cycled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling "Cycling") 2,100 km (1,300 mi) from [Sichuan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan "Sichuan") to [Tibet](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet "Tibet"), and now back in his home town [Jiande](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiande "Jiande") in eastern [Zhejiang Province](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang "Zhejiang"), spends his time reading [philosophy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy"), and gets by doing a few [odd jobs](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handyman "Handyman") and taking US$60 a month from his savings.[\[12\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-12)[\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-NYTChen-6) He only eats two meals a day.[\[13\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-13)

Luo's story quickly gained a following on [social media](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media "Social media"), being discussed and soon becoming a [buzzword](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword "Buzzword") on [Sina Weibo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo "Sina Weibo") and [Douban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douban "Douban"). The idea was praised by many and inspired numerous [memes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme "Internet meme"), and has been described as a sort of spiritual movement.[\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-BBC-1) Business magazine *ABC Money* claimed it resonated with a growing [silent majority](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_majority "Silent majority") of youth disillusioned by the officially endorsed "[China Dream](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Dream "China Dream")" that encourages a life of hard work and sacrifice with no actual [life satisfaction](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_satisfaction "Life satisfaction") to show for it, spawning the [catchphrase](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase "Catchphrase") "a [chive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_chive "Chinese chive") lying flat is difficult to reap" (躺平的韭菜不好割, *Tǎng píng de jiǔcài bù hǎo gē*).[\[14\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-14)

## Response[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tang_ping&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Response")

The [Chinese Communist Party](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party "Chinese Communist Party") (CCP) moved quickly to reject the idea through state-owned media. The powerful [CAC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace_Administration_of_China "Cyberspace Administration of China") internet regulator ordered online platforms to "strictly restrict" posts on *tang ping* and had censors remove Luo's original Tieba post ("Lying Flat Is Justice") while a discussion group of nearly 10,000 followers on Chinese social media site [Douban](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douban "Douban") is no longer accessible.[\[15\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-15) Selling *tang ping*\-branded merchandise online is forbidden.[\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-NYTChen-6) In May 2021, Chinese state media [Xinhua](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua "Xinhua") published an editorial asserting that "lying flat" is shameful.[\[16\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-16)[\[17\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-17) In May, a video clip of [CCTV](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_China_Television "Central China Television") news commentator [Bai Yansong](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Yansong "Bai Yansong") criticizing the low-key mindset circulated on the popular video-sharing website [Bilibili](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili "Bilibili"),[\[11\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-SixthTone-11) and had attracted thousands of mockeries and slurs on the *[danmu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danmu "Danmu")* commentaries in response.[\[18\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-18)[\[19\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-dwc66-19) An October article by [CCP general secretary](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party") [Xi Jinping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping "Xi Jinping"), published in the Communist Party journal *[Qiushi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qiushi "Qiushi")*, called for "avoiding 'involution' \[*nei juan*\] and 'lying flat'".[\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-scmp-oct-2021-8)[\[20\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-20)

However, there were official voices offering more empathic opinions on the *tang ping* phenomenon. Beijing's party-affiliated *[Guangming Daily](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangming_Daily "Guangming Daily")* newspaper added that *tang ping* should not be discounted without reflection—if China wants to cultivate diligence in the young generation, it should first try to improve their [quality of life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life "Quality of life").[\[11\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-SixthTone-11) Huang Ping, a literature professor who researches [youth culture](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_culture "Youth culture") at [East China Normal University](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China_Normal_University "East China Normal University"), told *[Sixth Tone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Tone "Sixth Tone")* that official media outlets may be concerned about the *tang ping* lifestyle because of its potential to threaten productivity, but "humans aren't merely tools for making things... when you can't catch up with society's development—say, skyrocketing home prices—*tang ping* is actually the most rational choice".
