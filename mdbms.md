Multidimensional Database = Cubes

- It is not a relational database
- Specialized "dimensionally-aware" database
- Leading alternative for 1st Generation DWs
- For smaller-scale [DW](#Data%20Warehouse)s and [DM](#Data%20Mart)s
- Advantages
  - Fast query response time
  - "Modest" data volumes
  - Less flexible data structures then [RDBMS](#RDBMS)
  - More vendor variations than you'd have with RDBMSs
