title: Wireless Network Topology
---

All of the logical topologies under [Wired Network Topology](#Wired%20Network%20Topology) apply to Wireless Network Topologies.

Wireless adds two more layers:

- Infrastructure Mode: Uses a wireless access point as a centralized point (like a star) and supports wireless security controls and centralized management.
- Ad Hoc Mode: Decentralized wireless network which created [Peer-to-Peer](#Peer-to-Peer) connections and does not require a router or an access point.
- Wireless Mesh Topology: Interconnection of different types of nodes, devices, or radios which consists of clients, routers, gateways and other devices (used to create redundant and reliable connections).
