title: Layer 3 Switch
---

- If you combine a [router](#router) and a [Switch](#Switch) you get a Layer 3 Switch
- It is a device used to connect multiple network segments together
- Can nmake Layer 3 routing decisions and interconnect entire networks (like a [router](#router)), not just network segments (like a [Switch](#Switch))
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.zapt16jgiw.png)
- Each of their port acts a [Broadcast Domains](#Broadcast%20Domains) and a [Collision Domains](#Collision%20Domains).
- A very efficient device for an internal network.
- If you've a large network a Layer 3 Switch is not recommnded as they're not as efficient at routing as a dedicated [router](#router) would be.
