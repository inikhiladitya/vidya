Operational Data Stores

- Just like a [Data Warehouse](#Data%20Warehouse) an ODS integreates data from multiple sources.
- Unlike a Data Warehouse, an ODS primarily focus on <span class="underline">current</span> operational data
- Often real-time data feeds from source applications are sent to an ODS, unlike batch oriented ETL feeds of a Data Warehouse.
- They're less popular now
- A lot of ODSes have been superseded by [Big Data](#Big%20Data) Technologies
- ODS components can be found within [Data Lake](#Data%20Lake)s
- "Traditional" ODSs still sometimes are used for mission critical situations
