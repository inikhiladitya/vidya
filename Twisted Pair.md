title: Twisted Pair
---

- `areas:` [[Linux]]

---

- Transmits electrons
- Twists reduces interference
- Most popular physical LAN media type
- Eight individually insulated strands of copper wire inside each cable
- Types:
  - Shielded([STP](#STP)) gives additional insulating barrier against electronic magnetic interference (beneficial where theres a lot of electrical noise)
  - Unshielded ([UTP](#UTP)) doesn't have extra protection but is useful in most standard office environments and is also cheaper.

#### T-568A wiring standard

- Often used for [Crossover Cable](#Crossover%20Cable), used to link older [Ethernet](#Ethernet) netowork switches, although modern switches can detect what type of cable is plugged in.
- Only one end of the cable is made using this standard.

#### T-568B wiring standard

- Used for [[Straight-Through Patch Cable]].
- Both end of the cables are twisted using this standard.

The thicker the copper the better, the more twists of the adjacent wires per inch to reduce crosstalk interference.

### Type of Twisted Pair Connectors

- RJ-45:

<!-- end list -->

- 8-pin connector in Ethernet networks
- Most Ethernet use only 4-pins
- It is a [Twisted Pair](#Twisted%20Pair) cable connector.
- You can also use it for token ring network if you've the appropriate equipment.

<!-- end list -->

- RJ-11:

<!-- end list -->

- 6-pin connector
- It is a [Twisted Pair](#Twisted%20Pair) cable connector
- Commonly only 2 or 4 pins are used
- Commonly found in telephone systems
- A basic telephone setup really requires only two wires
