Maladaptive daydreaming is a psychiatric condition. It was identified by Professor Eliezer Somer of the University of Haifa in Israel.
This condition causes intense daydreaming that distracts a person from their real life. Many times, real-life events trigger day dreams. These events can include:

- topics of conversation
- sensory stimuli such as noises or smells
- physical experiences
