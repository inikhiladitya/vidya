title: This too shall pass
---

"This too shall pass" (Persian: این نیز بگذرد, romanized: īn nīz bogzarad) is a Persian adage translated and used in several languages. It reflects on the temporary nature, or ephemerality, of the human condition. The general sentiment is often expressed in wisdom literature throughout history and across cultures, but the specific phrase seems to have originated in the writings of the medieval Persian Sufi poets.
