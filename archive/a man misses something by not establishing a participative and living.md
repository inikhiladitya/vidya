title: a man misses something by not establishing a participative and living
---

a man misses something by not establishing a participative and living relationship with the non-human world of animals and plants, landscapes and stars and seasons. By failing to be, vicariously, the not-self, he fails to be completely himself. â€” [[Aldous Huxley]]
