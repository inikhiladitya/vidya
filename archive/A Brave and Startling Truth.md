title: A Brave and Startling Truth
---

> Out of such chaos, of such contradiction
>
> We learn that we are neither devils nor divines . . .
> When we come to it
>
> We must confess that we are the possible
>
> We are the miraculous, the true wonder of this world
>
> That is when, and only when
>
> We come to it.
>
> — [[Maya Angelou]]
