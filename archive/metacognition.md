> Metacognition is, put simply, thinking about one’s thinking.  More precisely, it refers to the processes used to plan, monitor, and assess one’s understanding and performance. Metacognition includes a critical awareness of a) one’s thinking and learning and b) oneself as a thinker and learner.—via [Metacognition](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/metacognition/)
