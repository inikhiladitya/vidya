[Not even wrong - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong)

"Not even wrong" is a phrase often used to describe pseudoscience or bad science. It describes an argument or explanation that purports to be scientific but uses faulty reasoning or speculative premises, which can be neither affirmed nor denied and thus cannot be discussed rigorously and scientifically.
