A novella is a stand-alone piece of fiction that is shorter than a full-length novel but longer than a short story. Novellas incorporate many narrative and structural elements of novel-length stories, but they often focus on a single point of view. It would be reductive to think of the novella (or novelette) as simply a short novel, as there are many other hallmarks of the form that separate it from novels beyond just a basic word count.
