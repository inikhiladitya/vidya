> A recluse is a person who lives in voluntary seclusion from the public and society. The word is from the Latin recludere, which means "shut up" or "sequester". Historically, the word referred to a hermit's total isolation from the world.â€”via [Recluse - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recluse)
