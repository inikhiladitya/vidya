> A sanatorium is a medical facility for long-term illness, most typically associated with the treatment of tuberculosis in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century before the discovery of antibiotics. A distinction is sometimes made between "sanitarium" or the east-European "sanatorium" and "sanatorium".
