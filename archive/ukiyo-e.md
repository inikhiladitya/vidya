> Ukiyo-e is a genre of Japanese art which flourished from the 17th through 19th centuries. Its artists produced woodblock prints and paintings of such subjects as female beauties; kabuki actors and sumo wrestlers; scenes from history and folk tales; travel scenes and landscapes; flora and fauna; and erotica. The term 'ukiyo-e' (浮世絵) translates as "picture\[s\] of the floating world".—via [Ukiyo-e - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e)
