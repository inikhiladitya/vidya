title: The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry

> The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.

No matter how carefully a project is planned, something may still go wrong with it. The saying is adapted from a line in “To a Mouse,” by Robert Burns: “The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft a-gley.”
