title: Jack cannot support Bluetooth headphones

Jack cannot support Bluetooth headphones. Bluetooth headphone support is handled exclusively by PulseAudio (not even ALSA).

The reason for Jack not supporting Bluetooth audio devices is primarily because Jack is for low latency professional audio, and Bluetooth adds a lot of latency. Basically, it's outside of the scope of the project altogether.
